african immigration to the united states refers to immigrants to the united states who are or were nationals of africa .
the term african in the scope of this article refers to geographical or national origins rather than racial affiliation .
from the immigration and nationality act of 1965 to 2007 , an estimated total of 0.8 to 0.9 million africans immigrated to the united states , accounting for roughly 3.3 % of total immigration to the united states during this
african immigrants in the united states come from almost all regions in africa and do not constitute a homogeneous group .
they include people from different national , linguistic , ethnic , racial , cultural and social backgrounds .
as such , african immigrants are to be distinguished from african american people , the latter of whom are descendants of mostly west and central africans who were involuntarily brought to the united states by means of the historic atlantic
a small , electrically powered pump
a large , electrically driven pump ( electropump ) for waterworks near the hengsteysee , germany .
a pump is a device that moves fluids ( liquids or gases ) , or sometimes slurries , by mechanical action .
pumps can be classified into three major groups according to the method they use to move the fluid : direct lift , displacement , and gravity pumps .
pumps operate by some mechanism ( typically reciprocating or rotary ) , and consume energy to perform mechanical work by moving the fluid .
pumps operate via many energy sources , including manual operation , electricity , engines , or wind power .
lolita is a 1962 comedy-drama film by stanley kubrick based on the classic novel of the same title by vladimir nabokov , centres around a middle-aged man who becomes obsessed with a teenage girl .
the film stars james mason as humbert humbert , sue lyon as dolores haze ( lolita ) and shelley winters as charlotte haze with peter sellers as clare quilty .
due to the mpaa 's restrictions at the time , the film toned down the more provocative aspects of the novel , sometimes leaving much to the audience 's imagination .
the actress who played lolita , sue lyon , was fourteen at the time of filming .
kubrick later commented that , had he realized how severe the censorship limitations were going to be , he probably never would have made the film .
each antibody binds to a specific antigen ; an interaction similar to a lock and key .
an antibody ( ab ) , also known as an immunoglobulin ( ig ) , is a large y-shaped protein produced by b-cells that is used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and
the antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target , called an antigen .
each tip of the `` y '' of an antibody contains a paratope ( a structure analogous to a lock ) that is specific for one particular epitope ( similarly analogous to a key ) on an antigen , allowing
using this binding mechanism , an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system , or can neutralize its target directly ( for example , by blocking a part of
the production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system .
antibodies are secreted by a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell .
antibodies can occur in two physical forms , a soluble form that is secreted from the cell , and a membrane -bound form that is attached to the surface of a b cell and is referred to as the b
the bcr is only found on the surface of b cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells , or memory b cells that will survive in the body
in most cases , interaction of the b cell with a t helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the b cell and , therefore , antibody generation following antigen binding .
soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids , as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms .
antibodies are glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily ; the terms antibody and immunoglobulin are often used interchangeably .
antibodies are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains .
there are several different types of antibody heavy chains , and several different kinds of antibodies , which are grouped into different isotypes based on which heavy chain they possess .
five different antibody isotypes are known in mammals , which perform different roles , and help direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter .
though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar , a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable , allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures , or antigen binding sites , to
this region is known as the hypervariable region .
each of these variants can bind to a different antigen .
this enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens .
the large and diverse population of antibodies is generated by random combinations of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen binding sites ( or paratopes ) , followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene
antibody genes also re-organize in a process called class switching that changes the base of the heavy chain to another , creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen specific variable region .
this allows a single antibody to be used by several different parts of the immune system .

harmon clayton killebrew ( ; june 29 , 1936 – may 17 , 2011 ) , nicknamed `` killer '' and `` hammerin ' harmon '' , was an american professional baseball first baseman , third baseman , and left
during his 22-year career in major league baseball ( mlb ) , he played for the washington senators who later became the minnesota twins , and for the final season of his career , the kansas city royals .
when he retired , he was second only to babe ruth in american league ( al ) home runs and was the al career leader in home runs by a right-handed batter ( since broken by alex rodriguez ) .
he was inducted into the national baseball hall of fame in 1984 .
killebrew was a 6-foot tall , 195-pound hitter with a compact swing that generated tremendous power .
he became one of the al 's most feared power hitters of the 1960s , hitting 40 home runs in a season eight times .
in 1965 , he played in the world series with the minnesota twins , who lost to the los angeles dodgers .
his finest season was 1969 , when he hit 49 home runs , recorded 140 runs batted in ( rbi ) , and won the al most valuable player award .
killebrew led the league six times in home runs and three times in rbis , and was named to eleven all-star teams .
with quick hands and exceptional upper-body strength , killebrew was known not just for the frequency of his home runs but also for their distance .
he hit the longest measured home runs at minnesota 's metropolitan stadium , , and baltimore 's memorial stadium , , and was the first of just four batters to hit a baseball over the left field roof at detroit
despite his nicknames and his powerful style of play , killebrew was considered by his colleagues to be a quiet , kind man .
asked once what hobbies he had , killebrew replied , `` just washing the dishes , i guess . ''
after retiring from baseball , killebrew became a television broadcaster for several baseball teams from 1976 to 1988 , and also served as a hitting instructor for the oakland athletics .
he also divorced and remarried during this time , moving to arizona in 1990 and chairing the harmon killebrew foundation .

the waterboy is a 1998 american sports/comedy film directed by frank coraci ( who played robert 'roberto ' boucher , sr. ) , starring adam sandler , kathy bates , fairuza balk , henry winkler , jerry reed , larry
this was jerry reed’s final film appearance .
he died sept. 1 , 2008 , at the age of 71 from complications due to emphysema .
lynn swann , lawrence taylor , jimmy johnson , bill cowher , paul wight and rob schneider have cameo appearances .
the movie was extremely profitable , earning $ 161.5 million in north america alone .
this was sandler 's second film to eclipse $ 120 million worldwide in 1998 along with the wedding singer .
adam sandler 's character , bobby boucher ( pronounced `` boo-shay '' ) , bears a strong resemblance to his `` the excited southerner '' comedic skits from his album `` what the hell happened to me ? ``
the portrayal is one of a stereotypical cajun from the bayous of south louisiana , not the typical stereotype of a southerner .
he also shares similarities in speech and mannerism to canteen boy , a recurring character , also portrayed by adam sandler , on saturday night live .
like bobby , canteen boy preferred `` purified water , right out of the old canteen '' , which he always carried with him .
pertussis — commonly called whooping cough ( or ) — is a highly contagious bacterial disease caused by bordetella pertussis .
in some countries , this disease is called the 100 days ' cough or cough of 100 days .
symptoms are initially mild , and then develop into severe coughing fits , which produce the namesake high-pitched `` whoop '' sound in infected babies and children when they inhale air after coughing .
the coughing stage lasts approximately six weeks before subsiding .
prevention by vaccination is of primary importance given the seriousness of the disease in children .
although treatment is of little direct benefit to the person infected , antibiotics are recommended because they shorten the duration of infectiousness .
it is estimated that the disease currently affects 48.5 million people yearly , resulting in nearly 295,000 deaths .

spades is a trick-taking card game devised in the united states in the 1930s .
it can be played as either a partnership or solo/ '' cutthroat '' game .
the object is to take at least the number of tricks that were bid before play of the hand began .
in partnership spades , the bids and tricks taken are combined for a partnership .
spades is a descendant of the whist family of card games , which also includes bridge , hearts , and oh , hell .
its major difference as compared to other whist variants is that , instead of trump being decided by the highest bidder or at random , the spade suit is always trump , hence the name .
cardiovascular disease ( also called heart disease ) is a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels ( arteries , capillaries , and veins ) .
cardiovascular disease refers to any disease that affects the cardiovascular system , principally cardiac disease , vascular diseases of the brain and kidney , and peripheral arterial disease .
the causes of cardiovascular disease are diverse but atherosclerosis and/or hypertension are the most common .
additionally , with aging come a number of physiological and morphological changes that alter cardiovascular function and lead to subsequently increased risk of cardiovascular disease , even in healthy asymptomatic individuals .
cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of deaths worldwide , though since the 1970s , cardiovascular mortality rates have declined in many high-income countries .
at the same time , cardiovascular deaths and disease have increased at a fast rate in low- and middle-income countries .
although cardiovascular disease usually affects older adults , the antecedents of cardiovascular disease , notably atherosclerosis , begin in early life , making primary prevention efforts necessary from childhood .
there is therefore increased emphasis on preventing atherosclerosis by modifying risk factors , such as healthy eating , exercise , and avoidance of smoking .

the history of immigration to the united states is a continuing story of peoples from more populated continents , particularly europe and also africa and asia , crossing oceans to the new land .
historians do not treat the first indigenous settlers as immigrants .
starting around 1600 british and other europeans settled primarily on the east coast .
later africans were brought as slaves .
during the nation 's history , the growing country experienced successive waves of immigration which rose and fell over time , particularly from europe , with the cost of transoceanic transportation sometimes paid by travelers becoming indentured servants after their
at other times , immigration rules became more restrictive .
with the ending of numerical restrictions in 1965 and the advent of cheap air travel immigration has increased from asia and latin america .
attitudes toward new immigrants have cycled between favorable and hostile since the 1790s .

spiced strips of jerky
jerky is lean meat that has been trimmed of fat , cut into strips , and then dried to prevent spoilage .
normally , this drying includes the addition of salt , to prevent bacteria from developing on the meat before sufficient moisture has been removed .
the word `` jerky '' is derived from the spanish word charqui which is from the quechua word ch'arki .
which means to burn ( meat ) .
all that is needed to produce basic `` jerky '' is a low-temperature drying method , and salt to inhibit bacterial growth .
modern manufactured jerky is normally marinated in a seasoned spice rub or liquid , and dried , dehydrated or smoked with low heat ( usually under 70 °c/160 °f ) .
some makers still use just salt and sun-dry fresh sliced meat to make jerky .
some product manufacturers finely grind meat , mix in seasonings , and press the meat-paste into flat shapes prior to drying .
the resulting jerky from the above methods would be a salty and/or savory snack .
however , often a sweet or semi-sweet recipe is used , with sugar being a major ingredient ( in contrast to biltong which is a dried meat product that utilizes the acid in vinegar rather than salt to inhibit bacterial
jerky is ready-to-eat and needs no additional preparation .
it can be stored for months without refrigeration .
when the protein to moisture content ratio is correct , the resulting meat is cured , or preserved .
there are many products in the marketplace which are sold as jerky which consist of highly processed , chopped and formed meat , rather than traditional sliced , whole-muscle meat .
these products may contain more fat , but moisture content , like the whole-muscle product , must meet a 0.75 to 1 moisture to protein ratio in the us .
chemical preservatives can be used to prevent oxidative spoilage , but the moisture to protein ratio prevents microbial spoilage by low water activity .
many jerky products are very high in sugar and are therefore very sweet , unlike biltong , which rarely contains added sugars .
a typical 30 g portion of fresh jerky contains 10-15 g of protein , 1 g of fat , and 0-3 g of carbohydrates .
since traditional jerky recipes use a basic salt cure , sodium can be a concern for some people .
a 30 g serving of jerky could contain more than 600 mg of sodium , which would be about 30 % of the recommended usrda .
monument of tycho brahe and johannes kepler in prague
tycho brahe ( 14 december 154624 october 1601 ) , born tyge ottesen brahe , was a danish nobleman known for his accurate and comprehensive astronomical and planetary observations .
he was born in scania , then part of denmark , now part of modern-day sweden .
tycho was well known in his lifetime as an astronomer and alchemist .
in his de nova stella ( on the new star ) of 1573 , he refuted the aristotelian belief in an unchanging celestial realm .
his precise measurements indicated that `` new stars , '' ( stellae novae , now known as supernovae ) in particular that of 1572 , lacked the parallax expected in sub-lunar phenomena , and were therefore not `` atmospheric ''
using similar measurements he showed that comets were also not atmospheric phenomena , as previously thought , and must pass through the supposedly `` immutable '' celestial spheres .
as an astronomer , tycho worked to combine what he saw as the geometrical benefits of the copernican system with the philosophical benefits of the ptolemaic system into his own model of the universe , the tychonic system .
furthermore , he was the last of the major naked eye astronomers , working without telescopes for his observations .
tycho brahe was granted an estate on the island of hven and the funding to build the uraniborg , an early research institute , where he built large astronomical instruments and took many careful measurements , and later stjerneborg ,
on the island ( on which he demonstrated autocratic character and behavior toward the residents ) he founded manufactories such as paper-making to provide material for printing his results .
after disagreements with the new danish king christian iv in 1597 , he was invited by the bohemian king and holy roman emperor rudolph ii to prague , where he became the official imperial astronomer .
he built the new observatory at benátky nad jizerou .
here , from 1600 until his death in 1601 , he was assisted by johannes kepler who later used tycho 's astronomical data to develop kepler 's laws of planetary motion .
dylan thomas sprouse and cole mitchell sprouse ( born august 4 , 1992 ) are american actors .
they are twins and are collectively referred to as dylan and cole sprouse or the sprouse brothers , usually abbreviated as sprouse bros .
their first major theatrical film role was in big daddy , where they starred alongside adam sandler .
they later appeared in several television sitcoms and starred in the straight-to-dvd films , i saw mommy kissing santa claus and just for kicks .
in 2005 , they starred in the disney channel sitcom the suite life of zack & cody .
as a result of the series ' success , the media has termed them `` heartthrobs '' and `` overwhelming draws '' among preteen and teen audiences .
the following year , the brothers launched a franchise known as the sprouse bros brand , which included a clothing line , book series and magazine .
the majority of the sprouses ' franchise ended in 2008 , except for their clothing line .
the suite life of zack & cody was retooled in 2008 as the suite life on deck , in which the brothers reprised their roles as zack and cody .
the suite life on deck went on to become the most-watched tween/children 's television show in 2008 and 2009 .
the show ended in may 2011 .
they also starred in the the suite life movie , which aired in march of the same year .
they began cultivating an adult image by starring in the independent theatrical suspense film , the kings of appletown in 2009 .
dylan and cole were two of the wealthiest children alive in 2007 , and in 2010 , the sprouse brothers were the highest paid teenage disney television actors , earning $ 40,000 per episode combined .
msn reported by the end of the 2000s that the twin brothers became the richest teenage twins in the world .
in 2010 , the brothers were accepted to new york university .
they deferred admission for one year , and they began attending the university in the fall of 2011 .

it is named after saint patrick ( ad 385–461 ) , the most commonly recognised of the patron saints of ireland .
saint patrick 's day was made an official christian feast day in the early seventeenth century and is observed by the catholic church , the anglican communion ( especially the church of ireland ) , the eastern orthodox church and
the day commemorates saint patrick and the arrival of christianity in ireland , as well as celebrates the heritage and culture of the irish in general .
celebrations generally involve public parades and festivals , céilithe , and the wearing of green attire or shamrocks .
christians also attend church services , and the lenten restrictions on eating and drinking alcohol are lifted for the day , which has encouraged and propagated the holiday 's tradition of alcohol consumption .
saint patrick 's day is a public holiday in the republic of ireland , northern ireland , newfoundland and labrador and montserrat .
it is also widely celebrated by the irish diaspora around the world ; especially in britain , canada , the united states , argentina , australia and new zealand .
different religious groups include different books in their biblical canons , in varying orders , and sometimes divide or combine books , or incorporate additional material into canonical books .
christian bibles range from the sixty-six books of the protestant canon to the eighty-one books of the ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church canon .
the hebrew bible , or tanakh , contains twenty-four books divided into three parts ; the five books of the torah ( `` teaching '' or `` law '' ) , the nevi'im ( `` prophets '' ) , and
the first part of christian bibles is the old testament , which contains , at minimum , the twenty-four books of the hebrew bible divided into thirty-nine books and ordered differently from the hebrew bible .
the catholic church and eastern christian churches also hold certain deuterocanonical books and passages to be part of the old testament canon .
the second part is the new testament , containing twenty-seven books ; the four canonical gospels , acts of the apostles , twenty-one epistles or letters and the book of revelation .
the eastern orthodox , oriental orthodox and eastern catholic churches may have minor differences in their lists of accepted books .
the list given here for these churches is the most inclusive : if at least one eastern church accepts the book it is included here .

the wire premiered on june 2 , 2002 , and ended on march 9 , 2008 , comprising 60 episodes over five seasons .
each season of the wire focuses on a different facet of the city of baltimore .
in chronological order they are : the illegal drug trade , the seaport system , the city government and bureaucracy , the school system , and the print news media .
the large cast consists mainly of character actors who are little known for their other roles .
simon has said that despite its presentation as a crime drama , the show is `` really about the american city , and about how we live together .
it 's about how institutions have an effect on individuals .
whether one is a cop , a longshoreman , a drug dealer , a politician , a judge or a lawyer , all are ultimately compromised and must contend with whatever institution they are committed to . ''
despite only receiving modest ratings and never winning major television awards , the wire has been described by many critics as one of the greatest tv dramas of all time .

burbo bank offshore wind farm , at the entrance to the river mersey in north west england .
the shepherds flat wind farm is a 845 megawatt ( mw ) wind farm in the u.s. state of oregon .
wind power is the conversion of wind energy into a useful form of energy , such as using wind turbines to make electrical power , windmills for mechanical power , wind pumps for water pumping or drainage , or sails
large wind farms consist of hundreds of individual wind turbines which are connected to the electric power transmission network .
offshore wind is steadier and stronger than on land , and offshore farms have less visual impact , but construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher .
small onshore wind farms provide electricity to isolated locations .
utility companies increasingly buy surplus electricity produced by small domestic wind turbines .
wind power , as an alternative to fossil fuels , is plentiful , renewable , widely distributed , clean , produces no greenhouse gas emissions during operation and uses little land .
the effects on the environment are generally less problematic than those from other power sources .
as of 2011 , denmark is generating more than a quarter of its electricity from wind and 83 countries around the world are using wind power on a commercial basis .
in 2010 wind energy production was over 2.5 % of total worldwide electricity usage , and growing rapidly at more than 25 % per annum .
the monetary cost per unit of energy produced is similar to the cost for new coal and natural gas installations .
wind power is very consistent from year to year but has significant variation over shorter time scales .
the intermittency of wind seldom creates problems when used to supply up to 20 % of total electricity demand , but as the proportion increases , a need to upgrade the grid , and a lowered ability to supplant conventional
power management techniques such as having excess capacity storage , geographically distributed turbines , dispatchable backing sources , storage such as pumped-storage hydroelectricity , exporting and importing power to neighboring areas or reducing demand when wind production is low ,
in addition , weather forecasting permits the electricity network to be readied for the predictable variations in production that occur .

jacksonville is the largest city in the u.s. state of florida by population and the largest city by area in the contiguous united states .
it is the county seat of duval county , with which the city government consolidated in 1968 .
consolidation gave jacksonville its great size and placed most of its metropolitan population within the city limits ; with an estimated population in 2011 of 827,908 , it is the most populous city proper in florida and the southeast ,
jacksonville is the principal city in the jacksonville metropolitan area , with a population of 1,345,596 in 2010 .
jacksonville is in the first coast region of northeast florida and is centered on the banks of the st. johns river , about south of the georgia state line and about north of miami .
the jacksonville beaches communities are along the adjacent atlantic coast .
the area was originally inhabited by the timucua people , and in 1564 was the site of the french colony of fort caroline , one of the earliest european settlements in what is now the continental united states .
under british rule , settlement grew at the narrow point in the river where cattle crossed , known as wacca pilatka to the seminole and cowford to the british .
a platted town was established there in 1822 , a year after the united states gained florida from spain ; it was named after andrew jackson , the first military governor of the florida territory and seventh president of the
harbor improvements since the late 19th century have made jacksonville a major military and civilian deep-water port .
its riverine location facilitates two u.s. navy bases and the port of jacksonville , florida 's third largest seaport .
significant factors in the local economy include services such as banking , insurance , healthcare and logistics .
as with much of florida , tourism is also important to the jacksonville area , particularly tourism related to golf .
in 2010 , jacksonville was listed as a `` high sufficiency '' world city in the world cities study group’s inventory .
it ranks alongside cities such as liverpool and las vegas .

semen is produced and originates from the seminal vesicle , which is located in the pelvis .
the process that results in the discharge of semen is called ejaculation .
in chemistry , an alkali ( ; from arabic : al-qaly القلي , القالي ) is a basic , ionic salt of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal element .
some authors also define an alkali as a base that dissolves in water .
a solution of a soluble base has a ph greater than 7 .
the adjective alkaline is commonly used in english as a synonym for base , especially for soluble bases .
this broad use of the term is likely to have come about because alkalis were the first bases known to obey the arrhenius definition of a base and are still among the more common bases .
jameson is a single distillery irish whiskey produced by a division of the french distiller pernod ricard .
jameson is similar in its adherence to the single distillery principle to the single malt tradition , but jameson blends column still spirit with single pot still whiskey , a combination of malted barley with unmalted or `` green ''
the company was established in 1780 when john jameson established the bow street distillery in dublin .
jameson was scottish , a lawyer from alloa who had married margaret haig , a sister of the brothers who founded the main haig firms , and related to the steins , a scottish distilling family with interests in dublin
portraits of john and margaret jameson by sir henry raeburn are in the collection of the national gallery of ireland .
originally one of the six main dublin whiskeys , jameson is now distilled in cork , although vatting still takes place in dublin .
with annual sales of over 31 million bottles , jameson is by far the best selling irish whiskey in the world , as it has been sold internationally since the early 19th century when john jameson along with his son

`` gloria in excelsis deo '' ( latin for `` glory to god in the highest '' ) is a hymn known also as the greater doxology ( as distinguished from the `` minor doxology '' or gloria patri )
the name is often abbreviated to gloria in excelsis or simply gloria .
it is an example of the psalmi idiotici ( `` private psalms '' , i.e. compositions by individuals in imitation of the biblical psalter ) that were popular in the 2nd and 3rd centuries .
other surviving examples of this lyric poetry are the te deum and the phos hilaron .
troy ounce is a traditional unit of gold weight .
troy weight is a system of units of mass customarily used for precious metals and gemstones .
there are 12 troy ounces per troy pound , rather than the 16 ounces per pound found in the more common avoirdupois system .
the troy ounce is 480 grains , compared with the avoirdupois ounce , which is 4371⁄2 grains .
both systems use the same grain defined by the international yard and pound agreement of 1959 as exactly 0.06479891 gram .
although troy ounces are still used to weigh gold , silver , and gemstones , the troy pound is no longer used in most other applications .
plasma ( from greek πλάσμα , `` anything formed '' ) is one of the four fundamental states of matter ( the others being solid , liquid , and gas ) .
heating a gas may ionize its molecules or atoms ( reducing or increasing the number of electrons in them ) , thus turning it into a plasma , which contains charged particles : positive ions and negative electrons or ions
ionization can be induced by other means , such as strong electromagnetic field applied with a laser or microwave generator , and is accompanied by the dissociation of molecular bonds , if present .
the presence of a non-negligible number of charge carriers makes the plasma electrically conductive so that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields .
plasma , therefore , has properties quite unlike those of solids , liquids , or gases and is considered a distinct state of matter .
like gas , plasma does not have a definite shape or a definite volume unless enclosed in a container ; unlike gas , under the influence of a magnetic field , it may form structures such as filaments , beams
some common plasmas are found in stars and neon signs .
in the universe , plasma is the most common state of matter for ordinary matter , most of which is in the rarefied intergalactic plasma ( particularly intracluster medium ) and in stars .
much of the understanding of plasmas has come from the pursuit of controlled nuclear fusion and fusion power , for which plasma physics provides the scientific basis .

station identification ( ident or channel id ) is the practice of radio or television stations or networks identifying themselves on air , typically by means of a call sign or brand name ( sometimes known , particularly in the
this may be to satisfy requirements of licensing authorities , a form of branding or a combination of both .
as such it is closely related to production logos used in television and cinema , alike .
station identification used to be done regularly by an announcer at the halfway point during the presentation of a television program , or in between programs .
a leap year ( or intercalary or bissextile year ) is a year containing one additional day ( or , in the case of lunisolar calendars , a month ) in order to keep the calendar year synchronized with the
because seasons and astronomical events do not repeat in a whole number of days , a calendar that had the same number of days in each year would , over time , drift with respect to the event it was
by occasionally inserting ( or intercalating ) an additional day or month into the year , the drift can be corrected .
a year that is not a leap year is called a common year .
for example , in the gregorian calendar ( a common solar calendar ) , february in a leap year has 29 days instead of the usual 28 , so the year lasts 366 days instead of the usual 365 .
similarly , in the hebrew calendar ( a lunisolar calendar ) , adar aleph , a 13th lunar month is added seven times every 19 years to the twelve lunar months in its common years to keep its calendar year
the term leap year gets its name from the fact that while a fixed date in the gregorian calendar normally advances one day of the week from one year to the next , in a leap year the day of
for example , christmas day fell on saturday in 2004 , sunday in 2005 , monday in 2006 and tuesday in 2007 but then `` leapt '' over wednesday to fall on a thursday in 2008 .

john fitzgerald `` jack '' kennedy ( may 29 , 1917 – november 22 , 1963 ) , often referred to by his initials jfk , was the 35th president of the united states , serving from 1961 until his
after military service as commander of the motor torpedo boats pt-109 and pt-59 during world war ii in the south pacific , kennedy represented massachusetts ' 11th congressional district in the u.s. house of representatives from 1947 to 1953 as
thereafter , he served in the u.s. senate from 1953 until 1960 .
kennedy defeated vice president and republican candidate richard nixon in the 1960 u.s. presidential election .
at 43 years of age , he is the youngest to have been elected to the office , the second-youngest president ( after theodore roosevelt ) , and the first person born in the 20th century to serve as president
a catholic , kennedy is the only non- protestant president , and is the only president to have won a pulitzer prize .
events during his presidency included the bay of pigs invasion , the cuban missile crisis , the building of the berlin wall , the space race , the african-american civil rights movement , and early stages of the vietnam war
therein , kennedy increased the number of military advisers , special operation forces , and helicopters in an effort to curb the spread of communism in south east asia .
the kennedy administration adopted the policy of the strategic hamlet program which was implemented by the south vietnamese government .
it involved certain forced relocation , village internment , and segregation of rural south vietnamese from the northern and southern communist insurgents .
kennedy was assassinated on november 22 , 1963 in dallas , texas .
lee harvey oswald was charged with the crime , but he was shot and killed by jack ruby two days later , before a trial could take place .
the fbi and the warren commission officially concluded that oswald was the lone assassin .
however , the united states house select committee on assassinations ( hsca ) concluded that those investigations were flawed and that kennedy was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy .
however , abc news in their investigation , the kennedy assassination : beyond conspiracy , confirmed the findings of the warren commission ; having concluded oswald acted alone .
kennedy 's controversial department of defense tfx fighter bomber program led to a congressional investigation that lasted from 1963 to 1970 .
since the 1960s information concerning kennedy 's private life has come to light .
details of kennedy 's health problems in which he struggled have become better known , especially since the 1990s .
although initially kept secret from the general public , reports of kennedy 's philandering have garnered much press .
kennedy ranks highly in public opinion ratings of u.s. presidents .

j. m. flagg 's 1917 poster , based on the original british lord kitchener poster of three years earlier , was used to recruit soldiers for both world war i and world war ii .
flagg used a modified version of his own face for uncle sam , and veteran walter botts provided the pose .
uncle sam ( initials u.s. ) is a common national personification of the american government that , according to legend , came into use during the war of 1812 and was supposedly named for samuel wilson .
the first use of uncle sam in literature was in the 1816 allegorical book `` the adventures of uncle sam in search after his lost honor '' by frederick augustus fidfaddy , esq. an uncle sam is mentioned as early
it is not clear whether this reference is to uncle sam as a metaphor for the united states .
the lyrics as a whole clearly deride the military efforts of the young nation , besieging the british at boston .
the 13th stanza is :
old uncle sam come there to change
some pancakes and some onions ,
for ’lasses cakes , to carry home
to give his wife and young ones .
karma ( sanskrit , also karman , pāli : kamma ) means `` action '' or `` doing '' ; whatever one does , says , or thinks is a karma .
in buddhism , the term karma is used specifically for those actions which spring from the intention ( sanskrit : cetanā , pali : cetana ) of an unenlightened being .
these bring about a fruit ( sanskrit , pali : phala ) or result ( s. , p. vipāka ; the two are often used together as vipākaphala ) , either within the present life , or in the context
other indian religions have different views on karma .
karma is the engine which drives the wheel of the cycle of uncontrolled rebirth ( s. , p. ' ) for each being .
in the early texts it is not , however , the only causal mechanism influencing the lives of sentient beings .
as one scholar states , `` the buddhist theory of action and result ( karmaphala ) is fundamental to much of buddhist doctrine , because it provides a coherent model of the functioning of the world and its beings ,
a typical medical syringe with needle
a syringe is a simple pump consisting of a plunger that fits tightly in a tube .
the plunger can be pulled and pushed along inside a cylindrical tube ( called a barrel ) , allowing the syringe to take in and expel a liquid or gas through an at the open end of the tube .
the open end of the syringe may be fitted with a hypodermic needle , a nozzle , or tubing to help direct the flow into and out of the barrel .
syringes are often used to administer injections , insert intravenous drugs into the bloodstream , apply compounds such as glue or lubricant , and measure liquids .
the word `` syringe '' is derived from the greek συριγξ syrinx = `` tube '' via back-formation of a new singular from its greek-type plural `` syringes '' ( συριγγες syringes ) .

islam has been present in the united kingdom since its formation in 1707 , though it was not legally recognised until the trinitarian act in 1812 .
today it is the second largest religion in the country with results from the united kingdom census 2011 suggesting that by 2011 the total muslim population had reached 2.7 million , 4.8 % of the total population .
the vast majority of muslims in the united kingdom live in england and wales : of 1,591,000 muslims recorded at the 2001 census , 1,536,015 were living in england and wales , where they formed 3 % of the population
in 2011 , it was reported that united kingdom has around 100,000 converts to islam ( gaining 40,000 since 2001 ) with 66 % of them being women .

american football , known in the united states as football , is a team sport .
it is played by two teams , eleven players to a side , who advance an oval ball over a rectangular field that is 120 yards long by 53.3 yards wide and has goalposts at both ends .
the team in possession of the ball ( the offense ) attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball .
to continue their drive , the offense must advance the ball at least 10 yards down the field in a series of four downs .
if they succeed , they receive a new set of four downs to continue their drive .
otherwise , they lose control of the ball to the opposing team .
the offense can score points by advancing the ball into the end zone ( a touchdown ) or by kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalpost ( a field goal ) , while the defense can score points by
the team that has scored the most points by the end of the game wins .
american football evolved from early forms of rugby , particularly rugby union , and association football ( soccer ) .
the first game was played on november 6 , 1869 under a set of rules resembling those of rugby and soccer .
a set of rule changes instituted from 1880 onward by walter camp established the snap , eleven-player teams and downs .
later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the width of the football .
american football is the most popular sport in the united states today , and the national football league ( nfl ) is its most popular league .
the league 's championship , the super bowl , is among the most-watched club sporting events in the world .
the battle of iwo jima ( 19 february – 26 march 1945 ) , or operation detachment , was a major battle in which the united states armed forces fought for and captured the island of iwo jima from the
the american invasion had the goal of capturing the entire island , including its three airfields , to provide a staging area for attacks on the japanese main islands .
this month-long battle included some of the fiercest and bloodiest fighting of the war in the pacific of world war ii .
the imperial japanese army positions on the island were heavily fortified , with a dense network of bunkers , hidden artillery positions , and of underground tunnels .
the americans on the ground were aided by extensive naval artillery and the u.s. navy and marine corps aviators had complete air supremacy over iwo jima from the beginning of the battle .
american seapower and airpower were capable of delivering vast amounts of fire onto the japanese troops .
this invasion was the first american attack on japanese home territory , and the japanese soldiers and marines defended their positions tenaciously with no thought of surrender .
the japanese general in charge never considered surrendering to the americans to save his men , and he and his officers had vowed to fight to the death , no matter how hopeless their battle was .
iwo jima was also the only battle by the u.s. marine corps in which the overall american casualties ( killed and wounded ) exceeded those of the japanese , although japanese combat deaths were thrice those of the americans throughout
of the 22,000 japanese soldiers on iwo jima at the beginning of the battle , only 216 were taken prisoner .
some of them were captured because they had been knocked unconscious or otherwise disabled .
the rest were killed or missing and presumed dead .
despite the bloody fighting and severe casualties on both sides , the japanese defeat was assured from the start .
the americans possessed an overwhelming superiority in arms and numbers .
these factors , coupled with the impossibility of japanese retreat or reinforcement , ensured that there were no plausible circumstances in which the americans could have lost the battle .
the battle was immortalized by joe rosenthal 's photograph of the raising of the u.s. flag on top of the mount suribachi by five u.s. marines and one u.s. navy battlefield hospital corpsman .
the photograph records the second flag-raising on the mountain , both of which took place on the fifth day of the 35-day battle .
the picture became the iconic image of the battle and it has been widely reproduced .
stratocumulus stratiformis cumulogenitus
in meteorology , a cloud is a visible mass of liquid droplets or frozen crystals made of water or various chemicals suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body .
these suspended particles are also known as aerosols .
clouds in earth 's atmosphere are studied in the cloud physics branch of meteorology .
two processes , possibly acting together , can lead to air becoming saturated ; cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air .
in general , precipitation will fall to the surface ; an exception is virga , which evaporates before reaching the surface .
the international cloud classification system is based on the fact clouds in their most basic forms can show free-convective upward growth like cumulus , appear in non-convective layered sheets such as stratus , or take the form of thin fibrous
prefixes are used in connection with clouds to express variations or complexities in these basic forms or to specify middle or high altitude ranges .
these include strato- for low clouds with limited convection that form mostly in uneven layers , cumulo- for complex highly-convective storm clouds , nimbo- for thick layered clouds of some complexity that can produce moderate to heavy precipitation , alto-
whether or not a cloud is low , middle , or high level depends on how far above the ground its base forms .
cloud types with significant vertical extent can form in the low or middle altitude ranges depending on the moisture content of the air .
clouds in the troposphere have latin names due to the popular adaptation of luke howard 's cloud categorization system , which began to spread in popularity during december 1802 .
synoptic surface weather observations use code numbers to record and report the types of tropospheric cloud visible at each scheduled observation time based on the height and physical appearance of the clouds .
while a majority of clouds form in earth 's troposphere , there are occasions when clouds in the stratosphere and mesosphere can be observed .
these three main layers of the atmosphere where clouds may be seen are collectively known as the homosphere .
above this lies the thermosphere and exosphere , which together make up the heterosphere that marks the transition to outer space .
clouds have been observed on other planets and moons within the solar system , but , due to their different temperature characteristics , they are composed of other substances such as methane , ammonia , and sulfuric acid .

in 2006 , bryant scored a career-high 81 points against the toronto raptors , the second most points scored in a single game in nba history , second only to wilt chamberlain 's 100-point game in 1962 .
he was awarded the regular season 's most valuable player award ( mvp ) in 2008 .
after losing in the 2008 nba finals , bryant led the lakers to two consecutive championships in 2009 and 2010 , earning the nba finals mvp award on both occasions .
at 34 years and 104 days of age , bryant became the youngest player in league history to reach 30,000 career points .
he is also the all-time leading scorer in lakers franchise history .
since his second year in the league , bryant has been selected to start every all-star game .
he has won the all-star mvp award four times ( 2002 , 2007 , 2009 , and 2011 ) , tying him for the most all star mvp awards in nba history .
at the 2008 and 2012 summer olympics , he won gold medals as a member of the usa national team .
sporting news and tnt named bryant the top nba player of the 2000s .
in 2003 , bryant was accused of sexual assault after having sex with a hotel employee in edwards , colorado .
in september 2004 , prosecutors dropped the case after his accuser refused to testify .
a civil suit was later filed and settled out of court .
indian americans are citizens of the united states of indian ancestry and comprise about 3.18 million people , or ~1.0 % of the u.s. population , the country 's third largest self-reported asian ancestral group after chinese americans and filipino
the u.s. census bureau uses the term asian indian to avoid confusion with the indigenous peoples of the americas commonly referred to as american indians .
george o'malley is a fictional character from the medical drama television series grey 's anatomy , which airs on the american broadcasting company ( abc ) in the united states .
the character was created by series producer shonda rhimes , and was portrayed by actor t. r. knight from 2005 to 2009 .
introduced as a surgical intern at the fictional seattle grace hospital , o'malley worked his way up to resident level , while his relationships with his colleagues meredith grey ( ellen pompeo ) , cristina yang ( sandra oh )
o'malley married and divorced callie torres ( sara ramirez ) , and also entertained romantic correlations with meredith , stevens , and olivia harper ( sarah utterback ) .
knight auditioned for the show , expecting a one-season run .
in 2007 , knight 's co-star isaiah washington ( preston burke ) insulted him with a homophobic slur , which resulted in the termination of washington 's grey 's anatomy contract .
in 2009 , after the conclusion of the fifth season , it was confirmed that knight would not be returning for the show 's sixth season .
the actor stated the reason for his departure was due to a `` breakdown in communication '' with rhimes , his character 's lack of screen time , as well as his decision to be openly gay .
knight received generally positive reviews for his performance as o'malley , and garnered a nomination for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series at the 59th primetime emmy awards .
despite this , his death received mixed feedback .
this article is about the ballpark which opened in 2009 .
for the original stadium , on the south side of 161st street , go to yankee stadium ( 1923 ) .
yankee stadium is a stadium located in the bronx in new york city .
it is the home ballpark for the new york yankees , one of the city 's major league baseball ( mlb ) franchises .
it opened at the beginning of the 2009 mlb season as a replacement for the team 's previous home , the original yankee stadium , which opened in 1923 and closed in 2008 .
the new ballpark was constructed across the street , north-northeast of the 1923 yankee stadium , on the former site of macombs dam park .
the ballpark opened april 2 , 2009 , when the yankees hosted a workout day in front of fans from the bronx community .
the first game at the new yankee stadium was a pre-season exhibition game against the chicago cubs played on april 3 , 2009 , which the yankees won 7–4 .
the first regular season game was played on april 16 , a 10–2 yankee loss to the cleveland indians .
much of the stadium incorporates design elements from the previous yankee stadium , thus paying homage to yankee history .
although stadium construction began in august 2006 , the project of building a new stadium for the yankees is one that spanned many years and faced many controversies .
the stadium was built on what had been of public parkland .
replacement baseball fields opened in april 2012 .
also controversial was the price tag of $ 1.5 billion , which makes it not only the most expensive baseball stadium ever built , but the second-most expensive stadium of any kind ( after metlife stadium in east rutherford ,
the starving time at jamestown in the colony of virginia was a period of starvation during the winter of 1609–1610 in which all but 60 of 500 colonists died .
the colonists , the first group of whom had originally arrived at jamestown on may 14 , 1607 , had never planned to grow all of their own food .
their plans depended upon trade with the local native americans ' powhatan confederacy to supply them with food between the arrivals of periodic supply ships from england .
lack of access to water and a relatively dry rain season crippled the agricultural production of the colonists .
also , the water that the colonists drank was brackish and only drinkable half the year .
a fleet from england , damaged by a hurricane , arrived months behind schedule with new colonists , but without expected food supplies .
on june 7 , 1610 the survivors boarded ships , abandoned the colony site , and sailed towards the chesapeake bay , where another supply convoy with new supplies and headed by a newly appointed governor , thomas west ,
within a few years , the commercialization of tobacco by john rolfe secured the settlement 's long-term economic prosperity .
there is scientific evidence that the settlers at jamestown had turned to cannibalism during the starving time .
a table setting of afghan food in kabul .
afghan cuisine is largely based upon the nation 's chief crops ; cereals like wheat , maize , barley and rice .
accompanying these staples are dairy products ( yogurt and whey ) , various nuts , and native vegetables , as well as fresh and dried fruits ; afghanistan is well known for its grapes .
afghanistan 's culinary specialties reflect its ethnic and geographic diversity .
though it has similarities with neighboring countries , afghan cuisine is undeniably unique .
volcanic pipe
volcanic pipes are geological structures formed by the violent , supersonic eruption of deep-origin volcanoes .
they are considered to be a type of diatreme .
volcanic pipes are composed of a deep , narrow cone of solidified magma ( described as `` carrot-shaped '' ) , and are usually largely composed of one of two characteristic rock types — kimberlite or lamproite .
these rocks reflect the composition of the volcanoes ' deep magma sources , where the earth is rich in magnesium .
volcanic pipes are relatively rare .
they are well known as the primary source of diamonds , and are mined for this purpose .
coatesville is a town in clay township , hendricks county , indiana , united states .
the population was 523 at the 2010 census .
a continual improvement process , also often called a continuous improvement process ( abbreviated as cip or ci ) , is an ongoing effort to improve products , services , or processes .
these efforts can seek `` incremental '' improvement over time or `` breakthrough '' improvement all at once .
delivery ( customer valued ) processes are constantly evaluated and improved in the light of their efficiency , effectiveness and flexibility .
some see cips as a meta-process for most management systems ( such as business process management , quality management , project management , and program management ) .
w. edwards deming , a pioneer of the field , saw it as part of the 'system ' whereby feedback from the process and customer were evaluated against organisational goals .
the fact that it can be called a management process does not mean that it needs to be executed by 'management ' ; but rather merely that it makes decisions about the implementation of the delivery process and the design
points , sometimes also called a `` discount point '' , are a form of pre-paid interest .
one point equals one percent of the loan amount .
by charging a borrower points , a lender effectively increases the yield on the loan above the amount of the stated interest rate .
borrowers can offer to pay a lender points as a method to reduce the interest rate on the loan , thus obtaining a lower monthly payment in exchange for this up-front payment .
for each point purchased , the loan rate is typically reduced by 1/8 % ( 0.125 % ) .
paying points represent a calculated gamble on the part of the buyer .
there will be a specific point in the timeline of the loan where the money spent to buy down the interest rate will be equal to the money saved by making reduced loan payments resulting from the lower interest rate
selling the property or refinancing prior to this break-even point will result in a net financial loss for the buyer while keeping the loan for longer than this break-even point will result in a net financial savings for the buyer
the longer you keep the property financed under the loan with purchased points , the more the money spent on the points will pay off .
accordingly , if the intention is to buy and sell the property or refinance in a rapid fashion , buying points is actually going to end up costing more than just paying the loan at the higher interest rate .
points may also be purchased to reduce the monthly payment for the purpose of qualifying for a loan .
loan qualification based on monthly income versus the monthly loan payment may sometimes only be achievable by reducing the monthly payment through the purchasing of points to buy down the interest rate , thereby reducing the monthly loan payment .
discount points may be different from origination fee or broker fee .
discount points are always used to buy down the interest rates , while origination fees sometimes are fees the lender charges for the loan or sometimes just another name for buying down the interest rate .
origination fee and discount points are both items listed under lender-charges on the hud-1 settlement statement .
the difference in savings over the life of the loan can make paying points a benefit to the borrower .
if you intend to stay in your home for an extended period of time , it may be worthwhile to pay additional points in order to obtain a lower interest rate .
any significant changes in fees should be re-disclosed in the final good faith estimate ( gfe ) .
also directly related to points is the concept of the ' no closing cost loan ' .
if points are paid to acquire a loan , it is impossible at the same time for a broker bank or lender to make a premium for a higher rate .
when premium is earned by making the note rate higher , this premium is sometimes used to pay the closing costs .
a fiscal year ( or financial year , or sometimes budget year ) is a period used for calculating annual ( `` yearly '' ) financial statements in businesses and other organizations .
in many jurisdictions , regulatory laws regarding accounting and taxation require such reports once per twelve months , but do not require that the period reported on constitutes a calendar year ( that is , 1 january to 31 december
fiscal years vary between businesses and countries .
the `` fiscal year '' may also refer to the year used for income tax reporting .
some companies choose to end their fiscal year on the same day of the week , such day being the one closest to a particular date ( for example , the friday closest to 31 december ) .
under such a system , some fiscal years will have 52 weeks and others 53 weeks .
major corporations that adopt this approach include cisco systems .
in the united kingdom , a number of major corporations that were once government owned , such as bt group and the national grid , continue to use the government 's financial year , which ends on the last day
nevertheless , the fiscal year is identical to the calendar year for about 65 % of publicly traded companies in the united states and for a majority of large corporations in the uk and elsewhere ( with notable exceptions australia
many universities have a fiscal year which ends during the summer , both to align the fiscal year with the school year ( and , in some cases involving public universities , with the state government 's fiscal year )
in the northern hemisphere this is july in one year to june in the next year .
in the southern hemisphere this is january to december of a single calendar year .
some media/communication based organizations use a broadcast calendar as the basis for their fiscal year .
gertrude stein , 1935
the sentence `` rose is a rose is a rose is a rose. '' was written by gertrude stein as part of the 1913 poem sacred emily , which appeared in the 1922 book geography and plays .
in that poem , the first `` rose '' is the name of a person .
stein later used variations on the sentence in other writings , and `` a rose is a rose is a rose '' is probably her most famous quotation , often interpreted as meaning `` things are what they are ,
in stein 's view , the sentence expresses the fact that simply using the name of a thing already invokes the imagery and emotions associated with it , an idea also intensively discussed in the problem of universals debate where
as the quotation diffused through her own writing , and the culture at large , stein once remarked `` now listen !
i’m no fool .
i know that in daily life we do n't go around saying 'is a ... is a ... is a ... ' yes , i’m no fool ; but i think that in that line the rose is red for
( four in america )
she herself said to an audience at oxford university that the statement referred to the fact that when the romantics used the word `` rose '' it had a direct relationship to an actual rose .
for later periods in literature this would no longer be true .
the eras following romanticism , notably the modern era , use the word rose to refer to the actual rose , yet they also imply , through the use of the word , the archetypical elements of the romantic era
an embossed foil notary seal from the state of new york .
a notary public ( or notary or public notary ) in the common law world is a public officer constituted by law to serve the public in non-contentious matters usually concerned with estates , deeds , powers-of-attorney , and foreign
a notary 's main functions are to administer oaths and affirmations , take affidavits and statutory declarations , witness and authenticate the execution of certain classes of documents , take acknowledgments of deeds and other conveyances , protest notes and
any such act is known as a notarization .
the term notary public only refers to common-law notaries and should not be confused with civil-law notaries .
with the exceptions of louisiana , puerto rico , quebec , whose private law is based on civil law , and british columbia , whose notarial tradition stems from scrivener notary practice , a notary public in the rest of

leaving las vegas is a 1995 romantic drama film directed and written by mike figgis , based on a semi- autobiographical novel of the same name by john o'brien .
nicolas cage stars as a suicidal alcoholic who has ended his personal and professional life to drink himself to death in las vegas .
while there , he forms a relationship with a hardened prostitute , played by elisabeth shue , which forms the center of the film .
o'brien committed suicide two weeks after production of the film started .
a halt was considered , but work continued as a tribute .
leaving las vegas was filmed in super 16mm instead of 35 mm film which is most commonly used for mainstream film , although 16 mm is common for art house films .
after limited release in the united states on october 27 , 1995 , leaving las vegas made its nationwide release on february 9 , 1996 , receiving strong praise from critics and audiences .
cage received the golden globe award for best actor - motion picture drama and the academy award for best actor , while shue was nominated for the academy award for best actress .
the film also received nominations for best adapted screenplay and best director .
a coordinate measuring machine is a device for measuring the physical geometrical characteristics of an object .
this machine may be manually controlled by an operator or it may be computer controlled .
measurements are defined by a probe attached to the third moving axis of this machine .
probes may be mechanical , optical , laser , or white light , amongst others .
a machine which takes readings in six degrees of freedom and displays these readings in mathematical form is known as a cmm .

in physiology , body water is the water content of the human body .
a significant fraction of the human body is water .
arthur guyton 's textbook of medical physiology states that `` the total amount of water in a man of average weight ( 70 kilograms ) is approximately 40 litres , averaging 57 percent of his total body weight .
in a newborn infant , this may be as high as 75 percent of the body weight , but it progressively decreases from birth to old age , most of the decrease occurring during the first 10 years of life
also , obesity decreases the percentage of water in the body , sometimes to as low as 45 percent '' .
these figures are statistical averages , so are illustrative , and like all biostatistics , will vary with things like type of population , age and number of people sampled , and methodology .
so there is not , and can not be , a figure that is exactly the same for all people , for this or any other physiological measure .
for example , jackson 's ( 1985 ) anatomy & physiology for nurses gives a figure of 60 % for the proportion of body-weight attributable to water , which approximates guyton 's 57 % .
in diseased states where body water is affected , the compartment or compartments that have changed can give clues to the nature of the problem .
body water is regulated by hormones , including anti-diuretic hormone ( adh ) , aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide .
per netter 's atlas of human physiology , body water is broken down into the following compartments :
intracellular fluid ( 2/3 of body water ) .
per guyton , in a body containing 40 litres of fluid , about 25 litres is intracellular , which amounts to 62.5 % ( 5/8 ) , close enough to the 2/3 rule of thumb .
jackson 's texts states 70 % of body fluid is intracellular .
extracellular fluid ( 1/3 of body water ) .
per guyton 's illustration , for a 40 litre body , about 15 litres is extracellular , which amounts to 37.5 % again , this is close to the 1/3 rule of thumb cited here .
plasma ( 1/5 of extracellular fluid ) .
per guyton 's illustration , of the 15 litres of extracellular fluid , plasma volume averages 3 litres .
this amounts to 20 % , the same as per netter 's atlas .
interstitial fluid ( 4/5 of extracellular fluid )
transcellular fluid ( a.k.a. `` third space , '' normally ignored in calculations )
contained inside organs , such as the gastrointestinal , cerebrospinal , peritoneal , and ocular fluids .
child care or day care is the care of a child during the day by a person other than the child 's legal guardians , typically performed by someone outside the child 's immediate family .
day care is typically an ongoing service during specific periods , such as the parents ' time at work .
the service is known as child care in the united kingdom and australia and child care or day care in north america ( although child care also has a broader meaning ) .
child care is provided in nurseries or crèches or by a nanny or family child care provider caring for children in their own homes .
it can also take on a more formal structure , with education , child development , discipline and even preschool education falling into the fold of services .
some childminders care for children from several families at the same time , either in their own home ( commonly known as `` family day care '' in australia ) or in a specialized child care facility .
some employers provide nursery provisions for their employees at or near the place of employment .
child care in the child 's own home is traditionally provided by a nanny or au pair , or by extended family members including grandparents , aunts and uncles .
fleas are the insects forming the order siphonaptera .
they are wingless , with mouthparts adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood .
fleas are external parasites , living by hematophagy off the blood of mammals and birds .
some flea species include :
cat flea ( ctenocephalides felis )
dog flea ( ctenocephalides canis )
human flea ( pulex irritans )
moorhen flea ( dasypsyllus gallinulae )
northern rat flea ( nosopsyllus fasciatus )
oriental rat flea ( xenopsylla cheopis )
over 2,000 species have been described worldwide .
deer ( singular and plural ) are the ruminant mammals forming the family cervidae .
species in the cervidae family include white-tailed deer , mule deer such as black-tailed deer , elk , moose , red deer , reindeer ( caribou ) , fallow deer , roe deer and chital .
male deer of all species ( except the chinese water deer ) and also female reindeer grow and shed new antlers each year .
in this they differ from permanently horned animals such as antelope ; these are in the same order as deer and may bear a superficial resemblance .
the musk deer of asia and water chevrotain ( or mouse deer ) of tropical african and asian forests are not usually regarded as true deer and form their own families , moschidae and tragulidae , respectively .
the united states presidential election of 2008 was the 56th quadrennial presidential election .
it was held on tuesday , november 4 , 2008 .
democrat barack obama , then the junior senator from illinois , defeated republican john mccain , the senior senator from arizona .
as the campaign progressed , the war in iraq and outgoing republican president george w. bush had become increasingly unpopular , and the major-party candidates ran on a platform of change and reform .
domestic policy and the economy eventually emerged as the main themes in the last few months of the election campaign after the onset of the worst recession since the 1930s .
obama would go on to win a decisive victory over mccain in both the electoral and popular vote .
obama received the most votes for a presidential candidate in american history , and won the popular and electoral vote by the largest margin in 12 years , as well as the largest percentage of the popular vote for a
this was the first u.s. presidential election in which an african american was elected , having also been the first in which an african american won the nomination of either major party .
this election was also notable for being the first time in u.s. history that both major party candidates were sitting u.s. senators , only the third time ( after 1920 and 1960 ) that any sitting u.s. senator was elected
this was also the first election since 1952 in which neither of the major parties ' nominees was the incumbent president or vice president .
crocodiles ( subfamily crocodylinae ) or true crocodiles are large aquatic tetrapods that live throughout the tropics in africa , asia , the americas and australia .
crocodylinae , in which all its members are considered true crocodiles , is classified as a biological subfamily .
a broader sense of the term crocodile , crocodylidae , that includes the tomistoma , was excluded in this article since new genetic studies reveal the possibility of tomistoma as a close relative of the gharial .
this article applies the term crocodile only to the species within the subfamily of crocodylinae .
the term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order crocodilia : which includes all members of crocodylidae , including the tomistoma , the alligators and caimans ( family alligatoridae ) and the gharials
although they appear to be similar to the untrained eye , crocodiles , alligators and the gharial belong to seperate biological families .
the gharial having a very unique and narrow snout is easier to distinguish , while morphological differences are more difficult to spot in crocodiles and alligators .
the most obvious external differences are visible in the head with crocodiles having narrower and longer heads , with a more v-shaped than a u-shaped snout compared to alligators and caimans .
another obvious trait is the upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width , and teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the upper jaw when the mouth is closed ; therefore all
also when the crocodile 's mouth is closed , the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits into a constriction in the upper jaw .
for hard-to-distinguish specimens , the protruding tooth is the most reliable feature to define the family , the species belongs to .
crocodiles have more webbing on the toes of the hind feet and can better tolerate saltwater due to specialized salt glands for filtering out salt , which are present but non-functioning in alligators .
another trait that separates crocodiles from other crocodilians , are the much higher levels of aggression .
all reptiles , with the exception of testudines , are all scaled diapsids , but crocodilians are archosaurs , which means they are genetically closer to birds and the extinct dinosaurs , than other reptiles are .
although all crocodiles are anatomically and biologically similar ; their size , morphology , behavior and ecology somewhat differs between species .
however , they have many similarities in these areas as well .
all crocodiles are semiaquatic and tend to congregate in freshwater habitats such as rivers , lakes , wetlands and sometimes in brackish water and saltwater .
they are carnivorous animals , feeding mostly on vertebrates such as fish , reptiles , birds and mammals , and sometimes on invertebrates such as molluscs and crustaceans , depending on species and age .
all crocodiles are tropical species that unlike alligators , are very sensitive to cold .
they first separated from other crocodilians during the eocene epoch , about 55 million years ago .
a lineage , including the rest of crocodylomorpha , have been around for at least 225 million years , survived multiple mass extinctions , but today , due to habitat destruction and poaching , many species are at the risk
a natural arch produced by the erosion of differentially weathered rock in jebel kharaz , jordan
erosion is the process by which soil and rock are removed from the earth 's surface by exogenetic processes such as wind or water flow , and then transported and deposited in other locations .
while erosion is a natural process , human activities have increased by 10-40 times the rate at which erosion is occurring globally .
excessive erosion causes problems such as desertification , decreases in agricultural productivity due to land degradation , sedimentation of waterways , and ecological collapse due to loss of the nutrient rich upper soil layers .
water and wind erosion are now the two primary causes of land degradation ; combined , they are responsible for 84 % of degraded acreage , making excessive erosion one of the most significant global environmental problems .
industrial agriculture , deforestation , roads , anthropogenic climate change and urban sprawl are amongst the most significant human activities in regard to their effect on stimulating erosion .
however , there are many available alternative land use practices that can curtail or limit erosion , such as terrace -building , no-till agriculture , and revegetation of denuded soils .
albany is the 11th largest city in the u.s. state of oregon , and is the county seat of linn county .
it is located in the willamette valley at the confluence of the calapooia river and the willamette river in both linn and benton counties , just east of corvallis and south of salem .
it is largely a farming and manufacturing city .
settlers founded the community in 1848 .
as of the 2010 united states census , the population of albany was 50,158 .
its population was estimated by the portland research center to be 50,710 in 2012 .
albany has a home rule charter , a council–manager government , and a full-time unelected city manager .
the city provides the population with access to over 30 parks and trails , a senior center , and many cultural events such as river rhythms and mondays at monteith .
in addition to farming and manufacturing , the city 's economy depends on retail trade , health care , and social assistance .
in recent years the city has worked to revive the downtown shopping area , with help from the central albany revitalization area ( cara ) .
sir isaac newton ( 25 december 164220 march 1727 ) was an english physicist and mathematician who is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time and as a key figure in the scientific revolution .
his book philosophiæ naturalis principia mathematica ( `` mathematical principles of natural philosophy '' ) , first published in 1687 , laid the foundations for most of classical mechanics .
newton also made seminal contributions to optics and shares credit with gottfried leibniz for the invention of the infinitesimal calculus .
newton 's principia formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that dominated scientists ' view of the physical universe for the next three centuries .
it also demonstrated that the motion of objects on the earth and that of celestial bodies could be described by the same principles .
by deriving kepler 's laws of planetary motion from his mathematical description of gravity , newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric model of the cosmos .
newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a theory of colour based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into the many colours of the visible spectrum .
he also formulated an empirical law of cooling and studied the speed of sound .
in addition to his work on the calculus , as a mathematician newton contributed to the study of power series , generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents , and developed newton 's method for approximating the roots of a
newton was a fellow of trinity college and the second lucasian professor of mathematics at the university of cambridge .
he was a devout but unorthodox christian and , unusually for a member of the cambridge faculty , he refused to take holy orders in the church of england , perhaps because he privately rejected the doctrine of trinitarianism .
in addition to his work on the mathematical sciences , newton also dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology , but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his
in his later life , newton became president of the royal society .
he also served the british government as warden and master of the royal mint .

newsreader software is used to read newsgroups .
methamphetamine ( usan ) ( ) , also known as metamfetamine ( inn ) , meth , ice , crystal , glass , tik , n-methylamphetamine , methylamphetamine , and desoxyephedrine , is a psychostimulant of the phenethylamine and amphetamine
methamphetamine occurs in two enantiomers , dextrorotary and levorotary ; dextromethamphetamine possesses the well-known psychostimulant effects of the drug , while levomethamphetamine is cns -inactive .
although rarely prescribed , methamphetamine hydrochloride is approved by the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ) for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obesity under the trade name desoxyn .
illicitly , methamphetamine may be sold either as pure dextromethamphetamine or in a racemic mixture .
both dextromethamphetamine and racemic methamphetamine are schedule ii controlled substances in the united states , and similarly the production , distribution , sale , and possession of methamphetamine is restricted or illegal in many jurisdictions .
internationally , methamphetamine has been placed in schedule ii of the united nations convention on psychotropic substances treaty .
in low dosages , methamphetamine can increase alertness , concentration , and energy in fatigued individuals .
in higher doses , it can induce mania with accompanying euphoria , feelings of self-esteem and increased libido .
methamphetamine has a high potential for abuse and addiction , activating the psychological reward system by triggering a cascading release of dopamine in the brain characterized as amphetamine/ stimulant psychosis .
chronic abuse may also lead to post-withdrawal syndrome , a result of methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity to dopaminergic neurons .
post-withdrawal syndrome can persist beyond the withdrawal period for months , and sometimes up to a year .
in addition to psychological harm , physical harm – primarily consisting of cardiovascular damage – may occur with chronic use or acute overdose .
baptism of neophytes by masaccio , 15th century , brancacci chapel , florence .
baptism ( from the greek noun βάπτισμα baptisma ; itself derived from βαπτισμός baptismos , washing ) is a christian rite of admission ( or adoption ) , almost invariably with the use of water , into the christian church
baptism has been called a sacrament and an ordinance of jesus christ .
in some traditions , baptism is also called christening , but for others the word `` christening '' is reserved for the baptism of infants .
the new testament reports that jesus was baptized .
the usual form of baptism among the earliest christians was for the naked candidate to be immersed totally ( submersion ) or partially ( standing or kneeling in water while water was poured on him or her ) .
while john the baptist 's use of a deep river for his baptism suggests immersion , pictorial and archaeological evidence of christian baptism from the 3rd century onward indicates that a normal form was to have the candidate stand in
other common forms of baptism now in use include pouring water three times on the forehead .
martyrdom was identified early in church history as `` baptism by blood '' , enabling martyrs who had not been baptized by water to be saved .
later , the catholic church identified a baptism of desire , by which those preparing for baptism who die before actually receiving the sacrament are considered saved .
as evidenced also in the common christian practice of infant baptism , baptism was universally seen by christians as in some sense necessary for salvation , until huldrych zwingli in the 16th century denied its necessity .
today , some christians , particularly quakers and the salvation army , do not see baptism as necessary , and do not practice the rite .
among those that do , differences can be found in the manner and mode of baptizing and in the understanding of the significance of the rite .
most christians baptize `` in the name of the father , and of the son , and of the holy spirit `` ( following the great commission ) , but some baptize in jesus ' name only .
most christians baptize infants ; many others hold that only believer’s baptism is true baptism .
some insist on submersion or at least partial immersion of the person who is baptized , others consider that any form of washing by water , as long as the water flows on the head , is sufficient .
the term `` baptism '' has also been used to refer to any ceremony , trial , or experience by which a person is initiated , purified , or given a name—see other initiation ceremonies .

a moth is an insect related to the butterfly , both being of the order lepidoptera .
most of this order are moths ; there are thought to be approximately 160,000 species of moth ( nearly ten times the number of species of butterfly ) , with thousands of species yet to be described .
most species of moth are nocturnal , but there are crepuscular and diurnal species .
the mit sloan school of management ( also known as mit sloan or sloan ) is the business school of the massachusetts institute of technology , in cambridge , massachusetts , usa .
mit sloan offers bachelor 's , master 's , and doctoral programs , as well as non-degree executive education , and has over 20,000 alumni globally .
its largest program is its full-time mba , which is one of the most selective in the world , with students from more than 60 countries every year , and ranked # 1 in more subjects than any other mba
mit sloan places great emphasis on innovation and invention , and many of the world 's most famous management and finance theories—including the black–scholes model , the binomial options pricing model , the modigliani–miller theorem , the neoclassical growth model
several nobel laureates in economics and john bates clark medal winners have been on the faculty .
mit sloan management review , a leading academic journal focused on the management of innovation , has been published by the school since 1959 .
the tectonic plates of the world were mapped in the second half of the 20th century .
plate motion based on global positioning system ( gps ) satellite data from nasa jpl .
the vectors show direction and magnitude of motion .
remnants of the farallon plate , deep in earth 's mantle .
it is thought that much of the plate initially went under north america ( particularly the western united states and southwest canada ) at a very shallow angle , creating much of the mountainous terrain in the area ( particularly
plate tectonics ( from the late latin tectonicus , from the `` pertaining to building '' ) is a scientific theory that describes the large-scale motions of earth 's lithosphere .
the model builds on the concepts of continental drift , developed during the first decades of the 20th century .
it was accepted by the geoscientific community after the concepts of seafloor spreading were developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
the lithosphere is broken up into tectonic plates .
on earth , there are seven or eight major plates ( depending on how they are defined ) and many minor plates .
where plates meet , their relative motion determines the type of boundary : convergent , divergent , or transform .
earthquakes , volcanic activity , mountain -building , and oceanic trench formation occur along these plate boundaries .
the lateral relative movement of the plates typically varies from zero to 100 mm annually .
tectonic plates are composed of oceanic lithosphere and thicker continental lithosphere , each topped by its own kind of crust .
along convergent boundaries , subduction carries plates into the mantle ; the material lost is roughly balanced by the formation of new ( oceanic ) crust along divergent margins by seafloor spreading .
in this way , the total surface of the globe remains the same .
this prediction of plate tectonics is also referred to as the conveyor belt principle .
earlier theories ( that still have some supporters ) proposed gradual shrinking ( contraction ) or gradual expansion of the globe .
tectonic plates are able to move because the earth 's lithosphere has a higher strength and lower density than the underlying asthenosphere .
lateral density variations in the mantle result in convection .
plate movement is thought to be driven by a combination of the motion of the seafloor away from the spreading ridge ( due to variations in topography and density of the crust , which result in differences in gravitational forces
another explanation lies in the different forces generated by the rotation of the globe and the tidal forces of the sun and the moon .
the relative importance of each of these factors is unclear , and is still subject to debate ( see also below ) .
a 2.35:1 widescreen image letterboxed in a 1.33:1 screen
letterboxing is the practice of transferring film shot in a widescreen aspect ratio to standard-width video formats while preserving the film 's original aspect ratio .
the resulting videographic image has mattes ( black bars ) above and below it ; these mattes are part of the image ( i.e. , of each frame of the video signal ) .
ltbx is the identifying abbreviation for films and images so formatted .
the term refers to the shape of a letter box , a slot in a wall or door through which mail is delivered , being rectangular and wider than it is high .
a people meter is an audience measurement tool used to measure the viewing habits of tv and cable audiences .
the people meter is a 'box ' , about the size of a paperback book .
the box is hooked up to each television set and is accompanied by a remote control unit .
each family member in a sample household is assigned a personal 'viewing button ' .
it identifies each household member 's age and sex .
if the tv is turned on and the viewer does n't identify themselves , the meter flashes to remind them .
additional buttons on the people meter enable guests to participate in the sample by recording their age , sex and viewing status into the system .
the device , known as a 'frequency-based meter ' , was invented by a british company called audits of great britain ( agb ) .
the successor company to agb is tns , which is active in 34 countries around the globe .
originally , these meters identified the frequency of the channels - vhf or uhf - watched on the viewer 's tv set .
this system became obsolete when direct to home ( dth ) satellite dish became popular and viewers started to get their own satellite decoders .
in addition , this system does n't measure digital broadcasts .
before the people meter advances , nielsen used the diary method , which consisted of viewers physically recording the shows they watched .
however , there were setbacks with the system .
lower-rated stations claimed the diary method was inaccurate and biased .
they argued that because they had lower ratings , those who depended on memory for the diary method the may only remember to track their favorite shows .
stations also argued that if it wasn’t low ratings that skewed the diary method , it might also be the new variety of channels for viewers to choose from .
viewers may not be able to record everything they watch and there is no way of discovering the truth .
finally in 1986 , nielsen developed an electronic meter , people meter , to solve the problem .
the people meter is an electronic method of television measurement that moved from active and diary-based to passive and meter-monitored .
the meter also recorded real time simultaneously viewing , reducing memory bias .
because audits of great britain ( agb ) had just entered the u.s. market executing similar technology , nielsen felt the need to compete .
nielson made a substantial technological advance before network-era norms entered crisis with transition to the national people meter sample in 1987 .
although people meters presented substantial improvements over the previous system , the alteration in audience measurement caused significant controversy .
the method change costs stations whose audience had been overestimated.the end of the multi-channel transition was in large part due to the continuous changes in technology and distribution .
nielsen was at a disadvantage as their measuring techniques required burdensome adjustments .
luckily for nielsen , the advances in advertising strategies , distribution windows , and ways people were using television made industry sectors interested in data about viewing behavior .
along with changing their counting methods , nielsen also started emphasizing their sample in 2003 in reaction to census shifts and requests from some industry sectors .
nielsen’s automated local people meter ( lpm ) technology was introduced in new york and los angeles .
the lpm improved the method of measurement from active and diary-based to passive and meter-monitored .
the semicolon ( ; ) is a punctuation mark with several uses .
the italian printer aldus manutius the elder established the practice of using the semicolon to separate words of opposed meaning and to indicate interdependent statements .
`` the first printed semicolon was the work of ... aldus manutius `` in 1494 .
ben jonson was the first notable english writer to use the semicolon systematically .
the modern uses of the semicolon relate either to the listing of items or to the linking of related clauses .
in unicode it is encoded at .
according to lynne truss , a british writer on grammar , many non-writers avoid the colon and semicolon for various reasons : `` they are old-fashioned '' , `` they are middle-class '' , `` they are optional '' ,
however , the semi-colon is used frequently in academic writing .
`` black velvet '' is a blues verse with a rock chorus written by canadian songwriters christopher ward and david tyson , recorded by canadian singer songwriter alannah myles .
it was released in december 1989 as one of four singles from myles ' 1989 eponymous cd from atlantic records .
it became a number one hit for two weeks on the billboard hot 100 charts in 1990 and reached number one on the album rock tracks chart , as well as number one in canada and number two on the
the song hit no. 1 for two weeks on the billboard charts in april 1990 .
myles won the 1990 grammy for best female rock vocalist for the song .
since its release , the song has received substantial airplay , receiving a `` millionaire award '' from ascap in 2005 for more than four million radio plays .
heritability asks how much genetics are playing a role in differences in height between people .
this is not the same as asking how much genetics influences height in any one person.the
heritability of a trait within a population is the proportion of observable differences in a trait between individuals within a population that is due to genetic differences .
factors including genetics , environment and random chance can all contribute to the variation between individuals in their observable characteristics ( in their `` phenotypes `` ) .
heritability thus analyzes the relative contributions of differences in genetic and non-genetic factors to the total phenotypic variance in a population .
for instance , some humans in a population are taller than others ; heritability attempts to identify how much genetics are playing a role in part of the population being extra tall .
heritability is measured by estimating the relative contributions of genetic and non-genetic differences to the total phenotypic variation in a population .
heritability is an important concept in quantitative genetics , particularly in selective breeding and behaviour genetics ( for instance twin studies ) , but is less widely used in population genetics .
heritability measures the fraction of phenotype variability that can be attributed to genetic variation .
this is not the same as saying that this fraction of an individual phenotype is caused by genetics .
in addition , heritability can change without any genetic change occurring ( e.g. when the environment starts contributing to more variation ) .
a case in point , consider that both genes and environment have the potential to influence intelligence .
heritability could increase if genetic variation increases , causing individuals to show more phenotypic variation ( e.g. to show different levels of intelligence ) .
on the other hand , heritability might also increase if the environmental variation decreases , causing individuals to show less phenotypic variation ( e.g. to show more similar levels of intelligence ) .
heritability is increasing because genetics are contributing more variation , or because non-genetic factors are contributing less variation ; what matters is the relative contribution .
here we see why heritability is specific to a particular population in a particular environment .
the extent of dependence of phenotype on environment can also be a function of the genes involved .
matters of heritability are complicated because genes may canalize a phenotype , making its expression almost inevitable in all occurring environments .
individuals with the same genotype can also exhibit different phenotypes through a mechanism called phenotypic plasticity , which makes heritability difficult to measure in some cases .
recent insights in molecular biology have identified changes in transcriptional activity of individual genes associated with environmental changes .
however , there are a large number of genes whose transcription is not affected by the environment .
the church of saint george , lalibela
christianity in africa began in egypt in the middle of the 1st century .
by the end of the 2nd century it had reached the region around carthage .
important africans who influenced the early development of christianity include tertullian , clement of alexandria , origen of alexandria , cyprian , athanasius and augustine of hippo .
the spread of islam into north africa reduced the size of christian congregations as well as their number , so that of the original churches , only the coptic church in egypt , the ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church and the
both the ethiopian and eritrean orthodox churches profess their own distinctive customs , a unique canon of the bible and a distinctive architectures .
both these community of christians in sub-saharan africa which is not the product of european missionary work , but can document its foundation prior to any european countries .
christianity is embraced by the majority of the population in most southern african and central african states and others in some east and west africa .
the coptic christians make up a significant minority in egypt .
the world book encyclopedia has estimated that in 2002 christians formed 40 % of the continent 's population , with muslims forming 45 % .
in a relatively short time , africa has gone from having a majority of followers of indigenous , traditional religions , to being predominantly a continent of christians and muslims .
today in 2013 , traditional african religions is the majority religion only in togo .
in south sudan , no official statistics currently exist and some scholarly studies state that native african religion is more popular than christianity .
however , the most recent december 18 , 2012 pew forum research estimates that in 2010 , 6.010 million christians , 3.270 million traditional african religion followers , 610,000 muslims and 50,000 unaffiliated ( no known religion ) peoples lived
this would mean that in 2010 according to pew forum , about 60.46 % of the population of south sudan 's 9,940,000 population were christian while 32.9 % were followers of traditional african religions .
doctor of osteopathic medicine ( d.o. or do ) is a professional doctoral degree for physicians offered by medical schools in the united states .
holders of the d.o. degree are known as osteopathic physicians and have the same rights , privileges , and responsibilities as physicians with a doctor of medicine degree ( m.d. ) .
d.o. physicians are licensed to practice the full scope of medicine and surgery in all 50 states , and make up 7 percent of the total u.s. physician population .
there are over 77,784 d.o. physicians in the united states , of which 69,429 are in active practice .
currently , there are 29 medical schools with 37 locations throughout the united states that offer the d.o. degree , and 141 medical schools that offer the m.d. degree .
as of 2011 , 1 in 5 medical students in the united states were d.o. students .
the curricula at osteopathic medical schools are very similar to those at m.d.-granting medical schools .
four years in total length , the first two years of medical school focus on the biomedical and clinical sciences , followed by two years of core clinical training in the clinical specialties .
one notable difference in the education at d.o.-granting medical schools is the inclusion of 300 – 500 additional hours in the study of hands-on manual medicine and the body 's musculoskeletal system .
this training , referred to as osteopathic manipulative medicine , is absent in the m.d. curricula .
upon graduation from medical school , osteopathic physicians enter internship or residency training programs , which may be followed by fellowship training .
many d.o. physicians attend the same graduate medical education programs as their m.d. counterparts , and then take m.d. specialty board exams , while other d.o. graduates enter osteopathic programs and take d.o. specialty board examinations .
however , as of june 2015 , all post-graduate training for both d.o. and m.d. physicians will be accredited by the acgme .
the european theatre of world war ii , also known as the european war , was a huge area of heavy fighting across europe from germany 's invasion of poland on september 1 , 1939 until the end of the
the allied forces fought the axis powers on two fronts ( the eastern front and western front ) as well as in the adjoining mediterranean and middle east theatre .
operation torch ( initially called operation gymnast ) was the british – american invasion of french north africa in world war ii during the north african campaign , started on 8 november 1942 .
the soviet union had pressed the u.s. and britain to start operations in europe and open a second front to reduce the pressure of german forces on the soviet troops .
while the american commanders favored operation sledgehammer , landing in occupied europe as soon as possible , the british commanders believed that such a course would end in disaster .
an attack on french north africa was proposed instead , which would clear the axis powers from north africa , improve naval control of the mediterranean sea and prepare for an invasion of southern europe in 1943 .
american president franklin d. roosevelt suspected the african operation would rule out an invasion of europe in 1943 but agreed to support british prime minister winston churchill .

the royal standard used in england , northern ireland , wales , and overseas
the royal standard used in scotland .
for other monarchs ' standards , see royal standard .
the royal standard of the united kingdom is the flag used by elizabeth ii in her capacity as sovereign of the united kingdom and its overseas territories .
different standards are used in the queen 's other commonwealth realms , and the royal standard of the united kingdom is varied for use in scotland .
although almost universally called a standard , such flags when used in the united kingdom are banners of arms , as they comprise the shield of the royal arms .
outside the united kingdom , the royal standard is usually a nation 's banner of arms with a blue disc containing a wreath of gold roses encircling the crowned letter 'e ' , ( for 'elizabeth ' ) , superimposed
the royal standard of the united kingdom is flown when the queen is in residence in one of the royal residences .
it may be flown on any building , official or private , during a visit by the queen , if the owner or proprietor so requests .
the royal standard was flown aboard the royal yacht when it was in service and the queen was on board .
the only church that may fly a royal standard , even without the presence of the sovereign , is westminster abbey , which is a royal peculiar .
other churches generally are not allowed to hoist a royal standard .
the royal standard is flown at royal residences only when the sovereign is present .
if the union flag is flying above buckingham palace or windsor castle instead of the royal standard , the queen is not in residence .
if the ancient royal standard of scotland is flying above holyrood palace or balmoral castle , instead of the royal standard of the united kingdom used in scotland , it also indicates that the queen is not in residence .
when the queen attends the parliament at the palace of westminster , the royal standard flies from victoria tower .
unlike the union flag , the usual rule is that the royal standard is never flown at half-staff , even after the demise of the crown , as there is always a sovereign on the throne .
strictly speaking , however , the royal standard may be flown at half-staff above a building or on board a boat in which the unburied body of a deceased monarch is lying ( as long as the present monarch is
when controversy arose regarding the lack of a flag at half-staff over buckingham palace following the death of diana , princess of wales in 1997 , a compromise was reached whereby the union flag was flown at half-staff .
( the queen was then in summer residence in balmoral ; previously , no flag had flown over buckingham palace when the monarch was not present .
since then , the union flag has been flown in the queen 's absence . )
however the union flag can be lowered to fly at half-staff over buckingham palace , in times of national mourning ( for example after the death of the queen mother , the september 11 attacks and the 7 july 2005
the union flag was also flown at half-staff over buckingham palace as a mark of respect on the first anniversary of the death of diana , princess of wales on bank holiday monday 31 august 1998 ) .
the lateral aperture is a paired structure in human anatomy .
it is an opening in each lateral extremity of the lateral recess of the fourth ventricle of the human brain , which also has a single median aperture .
the two lateral apertures provide a conduit for cerebrospinal fluid to flow from the brain 's ventricular system into the subarachnoid space ; specifically into the cerebellopontine angle .
the structure is also called the lateral aperture of the fourth ventricle or the foramen of luschka after anatomist hubert von luschka .
pork chops , cooked and served .
a pork chop is a chop of pork ( a meat chop ) cut perpendicularly to the spine of the pig and usually containing a rib or part of a vertebra , served as an individual portion .
stem showing internode and nodes plus leaf petioles
a stem is one of two main structural axes of a vascular plant .
the stem is normally divided into nodes and internodes , the nodes hold buds which grow into one or more leaves , inflorescence ( flowers ) , conifer cones , roots , other stems etc .
the internodes distance one node from another .
the term shoots is often confused with stems ; shoots generally refer to new fresh plant growth and does include stems but also to other structures like leaves or flowers .
the other main structural axis of plants is the root .
in most plants stems are located above the soil surface but some plants have underground stems .
a stem develops buds and shoots and usually grows above the ground .
inside the stem , materials move up and down the tissues of the transport system .
stems have four main functions which are :
support for and the elevation of leaves , flowers and fruits .
the stems keep the leaves in the light and provide a place for the plant to keep its flowers and fruits .
transport of fluids between the roots and the shoots in the xylem and phloem .
storage of nutrients .
the production of new living tissue .
the normal life span of plant cells is one to three years .
stems have cells called meristems that annually generate new living tissue .
specialist rank insignia ( u.s. army )
specialist ( abbreviated `` spc '' ) is one of the four junior enlisted ranks in the u.s. army , just above private first class and equivalent in pay grade to corporal .
unlike corporals , specialists are not considered junior non-commissioned officers ( ncos ) .
spongebob squarepants ( often referred to simply as spongebob ) is an american animated television series , created by animator stephen hillenburg .
much of the series centers on the exploits and adventures of the title character and his various friends in the underwater city of bikini bottom .
the series ' popularity has prompted the release of a media franchise , contributing to its position as nickelodeon 's highest rated show , the most distributed property of mtv networks , and among nicktoons ' most watched shows .
it is listed 15th in ign 's top 100 animated series list .
when rocko 's modern life ended in 1996 , hillenburg began working on spongebob squarepants .
he teamed up with several nickelodeon veterans and rocko crew members , including creative director derek drymon ( action league now ! , hey arnold ! , and rocko 's modern life ) writers and directors sherm cohen , and
to voice the character of spongebob , hillenburg approached tom kenny , who had worked with him on rocko 's modern life .
`` steve described spongebob to me as childlike and naïve , '' kenny said in an interview .
`` he’s not quite an adult , he’s not quite a kid .
think a stan laurel , jerry lewis kind of child-man .
kind of like a munchkin but not quite , kind of like a kid , but not in a charlie brown child’s voice on the tv shows . ''
originally , spongebob was to be named spongeboy , but this name was already in use .
this was discovered after voice-acting for the original seven-minute pilot was recorded in 1997 .
the nickelodeon legal department discovered that the name was already in use for a mop product .
upon finding this out , hillenburg decided that the character 's given name still had to contain `` sponge '' so viewers would not mistake the character for a `` cheese man '' .
hillenburg decided to use the name `` spongebob '' .
he chose `` squarepants '' as a family name as it referred to the character 's square shape and it had a `` nice ring to it '' .
the pilot episode of spongebob squarepants first aired in the united states on nickelodeon on may 1 , 1999 , following the nickelodeon kids ' choice awards .
the first episodes were called `` help wanted `` , `` reef blower '' , and `` tea at the treedome `` .
the `` official '' series premiere followed on july 17 , 1999 , with the second episode , `` bubblestand/ripped pants . ''
the show reached enormous popularity by 2000 during the second season , and has remained popular since .
a feature film of the series was released in theaters on november 19 , 2004 , with a sequel in development and slated for release in late-2014 .
the series celebrated its tenth anniversary on july 17 , 2009 .
so far the series has aired 334 individual episodes .
it is currently nickelodeon 's longest-running cartoon , and currently in its ninth season .
spongebob surpassed rugrats ( in terms of number of episodes ) when spongebob aired its 173rd episode on april 11 , 2012 ( while rugrats had 172 episodes ) .
on april 12 , 2012 , spongebob aired its 174th episode and has produced 204 episodes , and more episodes will be produced , marking it as the first nicktoon to have 200 or more episodes .
on july 21 , 2012 , spongebob was renewed and aired its ninth season .
this is the first spongebob season to have regular episodes produced in widescreen .

active learning is an umbrella term that refers to several models of instruction that focus the responsibility of learning on learners .
bonwell and eison ( 1991 ) popularized this approach to instruction .
this `` buzz word '' of the 1980s became their 1990s report to the association for the study of higher education ( ashe ) .
in this report they discuss a variety of methodologies for promoting `` active learning '' .
they cite literature which indicates that to learn , students must do more than just listen : they must read , write , discuss , or be engaged in solving problems .
in particular , students must engage in such higher-order thinking tasks as analysis , synthesis , and evaluation .
`` i wan na dance with somebody ( who loves me ) '' is the first single from whitney houston 's second studio album whitney .
it was produced by narada michael walden , and written by george merrill and shannon rubicam of the band boy meets girl , who had previously written the number-one whitney houston hit `` how will i know `` .
the original arrangement was more of a country tune , but was transformed by walden to make it a dance song .
the song received mixed reviews from critics , who compared the musical arrangement to her own `` how will i know `` and cyndi lauper 's `` girls just want to have fun `` .
the song won the grammy award for best female pop vocal performance at the 30th grammy awards , and in later years received better reviews , being considered a 1980s gem .
the single was a commercial success , topping the charts in 13 countries including australia , germany and the uk .
in the us , it became her fourth consecutive number one single and sold over one million copies , making it her biggest hit in that country at the time .
it was eventually surpassed by her version of `` i will always love you `` .
wal-mart stores , inc. ( ) , branded as walmart , is an american multinational retail corporation that runs chains of large discount department stores and warehouse stores .
the company is the world 's third largest public corporation , according to the fortune global 500 list in 2012 , the biggest private employer in the world with over two million employees , and is the largest retailer in
walmart remains a family-owned business , as the company is controlled by the walton family , who own a 48 percent stake in walmart .
it is also one of the world 's most valuable companies .
the company was founded by sam walton in 1962 , incorporated on october 31 , 1969 , and publicly traded on the new york stock exchange in 1972 .
it is headquartered in bentonville , arkansas .
walmart is also the largest grocery retailer in the united states .
in 2009 , it generated 51 percent of its us $ 258 billion sales in the u.s. from grocery business .
it also owns and operates the sam 's club retail warehouses in north america .
by 1988 , wal-mart was the most profitable retailer in the us , and by november 1990 , it outsold k-mart .
by 1991 it outsold sears in retail , making it america 's largest retailer , a distinction it still holds .
walmart has 8,500 stores in 15 countries , under 55 different names .
the company operates under the walmart name in the united states , including the 50 states and puerto rico .
it operates in mexico as walmex , in the united kingdom as asda , in japan as seiyu , and in india as best price .
it has wholly owned operations in argentina , brazil , and canada .
walmart 's investments outside north america have had mixed results : its operations in the united kingdom , south america , and china are highly successful , whereas ventures in germany and south korea were unsuccessful .
the qing dynasty , also empire of the great qing or great qing , was the last imperial dynasty of china , ruling from 1644 to 1912 with a brief , abortive restoration in 1917 .
it was preceded by the ming dynasty and succeeded by the republic of china .
the dynasty was founded by the jurchen aisin gioro clan in contemporary northeastern china .
the aisin gioro leader , nurhachi , who was originally a vassal of the ming emperors , began unifying the jurchen clans in the late sixteenth century .
by 1635 , nurhachi 's son hong taiji could claim they constituted a single and united manchu people and began forcing the ming out of liaoning in southern manchuria .
in 1644 , the ming capital beijing was sacked by a peasant revolt led by li zicheng , a former minor ming official who became the leader of the peasant revolt , who then proclaimed the shun dynasty .
the last ming ruler , the chongzhen emperor , committed suicide when the city fell .

texas is nicknamed the lone star state to signify texas as a former independent republic and as a reminder of the state 's struggle for independence from mexico .
the `` lone star '' can be found on the texas state flag and on the texas state seal today .
due to its size and geologic features such as the balcones fault , texas contains diverse landscapes that resemble both the american south and southwest .
although texas is popularly associated with the southwestern deserts , less than 10 % of the land area is desert .
most of the population centers are located in areas of former prairies , grasslands , forests , and the coastline .
traveling from east to west , one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods , to rolling plains and rugged hills , and finally the desert and mountains of the big bend .
the term `` six flags over texas `` came from the several nations that had ruled over the territory .
spain was the first european country to claim the area of texas .
france held a short-lived colony in texas .
mexico controlled the territory until 1836 when texas won its independence , becoming an independent republic .
in 1845 it joined the united states as the 28th state .
the state 's annexation set off a chain of events that caused the mexican–american war in 1846 .
a slave state , texas declared its secession from the united states in early 1861 , joining the confederate states of america during the american civil war .
after the war and its restoration to the union , texas entered a long period of economic stagnation .
one texas industry that thrived after the civil war was cattle .
due to its long history as a center of the industry , texas is associated with the image of the cowboy .
the state 's economic fortunes changed in the early 20th century , when oil discoveries initiated an economic boom in the state .
with strong investments in universities , texas developed a diversified economy and high tech industry in the mid-20th century .
as of 2010 it shares the top of the list of the most fortune 500 companies with california at 57 .
with a growing base of industry , the state leads in many industries , including agriculture , petrochemicals , energy , computers and electronics , aerospace , and biomedical sciences .

the matrix is a 1999 american–australian science fiction action film written and directed by the wachowski brothers and starring keanu reeves , laurence fishburne , carrie-anne moss , joe pantoliano , and hugo weaving .
it depicts a dystopian future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called `` the matrix '' , created by sentient machines to subdue the human population , while their bodies ' heat and
computer programmer `` neo `` learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines , which involves other people who have been freed from the `` dream world '' .
the matrix is known for popularizing a visual effect known as `` bullet time `` , in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera
the film is an example of the cyberpunk science fiction genre .
it contains numerous references to philosophical and religious ideas , and prominently pays homage to works such as jean baudrillard 's simulacra and simulation and lewis carroll 's alice 's adventures in wonderland .
the wachowskis ' approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration for japanese animation and martial arts films , and the film 's use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from hong kong action cinema was influential upon subsequent
the matrix was first released in the united states on , 1999 , and grossed over $ 460 million worldwide .
it was generally well-received by critics , and won four academy awards as well as other accolades including bafta awards and saturn awards .
reviewers praised the matrix for its innovative visual effects , cinematography and its entertainment .
the film 's premise was both criticized for being derivative of earlier science fiction works , and praised for being intriguing .
the action also polarized critics , some describing it as impressive , but others dismissing it as a trite distraction from an interesting premise .
despite this , the film has since appeared in lists of the greatest science fiction films , and in 2012 , was added to the national film registry for preservation .
the success of the film led to the release of two feature film sequels , both written and directed by the wachowskis , the matrix reloaded and the matrix revolutions .
the matrix franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books , video games , and animated short films in which the wachowskis were heavily involved .
the often-used six sigma symbol
six sigma is a set of tools and strategies for process improvement originally developed by motorola in 1985 .
six sigma became well known after jack welch made it a central focus of his business strategy at general electric in 1995 , and today it is used in different sectors of industry .
six sigma seeks to improve the quality of process outputs by identifying and removing the causes of defects ( errors ) and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes .
it uses a set of quality management methods , including statistical methods , and creates a special infrastructure of people within the organization ( `` champions '' , `` black belts '' , `` green belts '' , `` orange
each six sigma project carried out within an organization follows a defined sequence of steps and has quantified value targets , for example ; process cycle time reduction , customer satisfaction , reduction in pollution , cost reduction and/or profit
the term six sigma originated from terminology associated with manufacturing , specifically terms associated with statistical modeling of manufacturing processes .
the maturity of a manufacturing process can be described by a sigma rating indicating its yield or the percentage of defect-free products it creates .
a six sigma process is one in which 99.99966 % of the products manufactured are statistically expected to be free of defects ( 3.4 defects per million ) , although , as discussed below , this defect level corresponds to
motorola set a goal of `` six sigma '' for all of its manufacturing operations , and this goal became a byword for the management and engineering practices used to achieve it .

world war i ( wwi ) was a global war centred in europe that began on 28 july 1914 and lasted until 11 november 1918 .
it was predominantly called the world war or the great war from its occurrence until the start of world war ii in 1939 , and the first world war or world war i thereafter .
it involved all the world 's great powers , which were assembled in two opposing alliances : the allies ( based on the triple entente of the united kingdom , france and russia ) and the central powers ( originally
these alliances were both reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war : italy , japan and the united states joined the allies , and the ottoman empire and bulgaria the central powers .
ultimately , more than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million europeans , were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history .
more than 9 million combatants were killed , largely because of technological advancements that led to enormous increases in the lethality of weapons without corresponding improvements in protection or mobility .
it was the fifth- deadliest conflict in world history , subsequently paving the way for various political changes , such as revolutions in many of the nations involved .
one of the long-term causes of the war was the resurgence of imperialism in the foreign policies of the great powers of europe .
more immediately , the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand of austria , the heir to the throne of austria-hungary , on 28 june 1914 by yugoslav nationalist gavrilo princip in sarajevo triggered a diplomatic crisis when austria-hungary subsequently delivered an
several alliances formed over the previous decades were invoked .
within weeks , the major powers were at war and , via their colonies , the conflict soon spread around the world .
on 28 july , the austro-hungarians fired the first shots of the war as preparation for the invasion of serbia .
while the russians mobilised , the germans invaded neutral belgium and luxembourg on the way to france , providing a casus belli for britain 's declaration of war against germany .
after the german march on paris was brought to a halt—the so-called miracle of the marne —the western front settled into a static battle of attrition with a trench line that changed little until 1917 .
on the eastern front , the russian army was successful against the austro-hungarians , but was stopped in its invasion of east prussia by the germans .
in november the ottoman empire joined the war , opening up fronts in the caucasus , mesopotamia and the sinai .
italy and bulgaria went to war in 1915 and romania in 1916 .
in russia , the tsar 's government collapsed in march 1917 and a subsequent revolution in november brought the russians to terms with the central powers .
after a 1918 german offensive along the western front , the allies drove back the germans in a series of successful offensives and american forces began entering the trenches .
germany , which had its own trouble with revolutionaries , agreed to an armistice on 11 november 1918 .
the war ended in victory for the allies .
events on the home fronts were as tumultuous as on the battle fronts , as the participants tried to mobilize their manpower and economic resources to fight a total war .
by the end of the war , four major imperial powers—the german , russian , austro-hungarian and ottoman empires—ceased to exist .
the successor states of the former two lost a great amount of territory , while the latter two were dismantled entirely .
the map of central europe was redrawn into several smaller states .
the league of nations was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict .
the european nationalism spawned by the war and the breakup of empires , the repercussions of germany 's defeat and problems with the treaty of versailles are agreed to be factors contributing to world war ii .
the mexican war of independence ( 1810–1821 ) was an armed conflict between the people of mexico and the spanish colonial authorities which started on september 16 , 1810 .
the movement , which became known as the mexican war of independence , was led by mexican-born spaniards , mestizos and amerindians who sought independence from spain .
it started as an idealistic peasants ' rebellion against their colonial masters , but ended as an unlikely alliance between mexican ex-royalists and mexican guerrilla insurgents .

a monarchy is a form of government in which sovereignty is actually or nominally embodied in a single individual ( the monarch ) .
king solomon 's royal court .
forms of monarchy differ widely based on the level of legal autonomy the monarch holds in governance , the method of selection of the monarch , and any predetermined limits on the length of their tenure .
when the monarch has no or few legal restraints in state and political matters , it is called an absolute monarchy and is a form of autocracy .
cases in which the monarch 's discretion is formally limited ( most common today ) are called constitutional monarchies .
in hereditary monarchies , the office is passed through inheritance within a family group , whereas elective monarchies are selected by some system of voting .
historically these systems are most commonly combined , either formally or informally , in some manner .
( for instance , in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are considered eligible , whereas many hereditary monarchies have legal requirements regarding the religion , age , gender , mental capacity , and other factors that act
finally , there are situations in which the expiration of a monarch’s reign is set based either on the calendar or on the achievement of certain goals ( repulse of invasion , for instance . )
the effect of historical and geographic difference along each of these three axes is to create widely divergent structures and traditions defining “monarchy.”
king leopold i , an elected founder of the hereditary monarchy of belgium .
monarchy was the most common form of government into the 19th century , but it is no longer prevalent , at least at the national level .
where it exists , it now often takes the form of constitutional monarchy , in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role , but exercises limited or no political power pursuant to a constitution or tradition which
currently , 44 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state , 16 of which are commonwealth realms that recognize queen elizabeth ii as their head of state .
all european monarchies are constitutional ones , with the exception of the vatican city , but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger .
the monarchs of cambodia , japan , jordan , malaysia and morocco `` reign , but do not rule '' although there is considerable variation in the amount of authority they wield .
although they reign under constitutions , the monarchs of brunei , oman , qatar , saudi arabia and swaziland appear to continue to exercise more political influence than any other single source of authority in their nations , either by

the statue of liberty ( liberty enlightening the world ; french : la liberté éclairant le monde ) is a neoclassical sculpture on liberty island in new york harbor , designed by frédéric bartholdi and dedicated on october 28 ,
the statue , a gift to the united states from the people of france , is of a robed female figure representing libertas , the roman goddess of freedom , who bears a torch and a tabula ansata ( a
a broken chain lies at her feet .
the statue is an icon of freedom and of the united states : a welcoming signal to immigrants arriving from abroad .
bartholdi was inspired by french law professor and politician édouard rené de laboulaye , who commented in 1865 that any monument raised to american independence would properly be a joint project of the french and american peoples .
due to the troubled political situation in france , work on the statue did not commence until the early 1870s .
in 1875 , laboulaye proposed that the french finance the statue and the americans provide the site and build the pedestal .
bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed , and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions .
the torch-bearing arm displayed at the centennial exposition in 1876 and in new york 's madison square park from 1876 to 1882 .
fundraising proved difficult , especially for the americans , and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened due to lack of funds .
publisher joseph pulitzer of the world started a drive for donations to complete the project that attracted more than 120,000 contributors , most of whom gave less than a dollar .
the statue was constructed in france , shipped overseas in crates , and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called bedloe 's island .
the statue 's completion was marked by new york 's first ticker-tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by president grover cleveland .
the statue was administered by the united states lighthouse board until 1901 and then by the department of war ; since 1933 it has been maintained by the national park service .
the statue was closed for renovation for much of 1938 .
in the early 1980s , it was found to have deteriorated to such an extent that a major restoration was required .
while the statue was closed from 1984 to 1986 , the torch and a large part of the internal structure were replaced .
after the september 11 attacks in 2001 , it was closed for reasons of safety and security ; the pedestal reopened in 2004 and the statue in 2009 , with limits on the number of visitors allowed to ascend to
the statue , including the pedestal and base , was closed for a year until october 28 , 2012 , so that a secondary staircase and other safety features could be installed ; liberty island remained open .
however , one day after the reopening , liberty island closed due to the effects of hurricane sandy , and the island remains off limits to the public .
public access to the balcony surrounding the torch has been barred for safety reasons since 1916 .
the statue will reopen to the public by july 4 , 2013 .

it is the 3,6- diacetyl ester of morphine , and functions as a morphine prodrug , meaning that it is metabolically converted to morphine inside the body in order for it to work .
when used in medicine it is typically used to treat severe pain , such as that resulting from a heart attack or a severe injury .
the name `` heroin '' is only used when being discussed in its illegal form .
when it is used in a medical environment , it is referred to as diamorphine .
the white crystalline form considered `` pure heroin '' is usually the hydrochloride salt , diacetylmorphine hydrochloride .
illicit heroin is usually in freebase form , dulling the sheen and consistency to a matte-white powder .
because of its lower boiling point , the freebase form of heroin is also smokable .
it is prevalent in heroin coming from afghanistan , which as of 2004 produced roughly 87 % of the world supply in illicit raw opium .
however , production in mexico has risen six times from 2007 to 2011 , changing that percentage and placing mexico as the second largest opium producer in the world .
mexican cartels are also known to produce a third type of illicit heroin , commonly called black tar , which results from a simplified , quicker synthesis procedure and contains a high percentage of morphine derivates other than heroin ,
as with other opioids , diacetylmorphine is used as both an analgesic and a recreational drug .
frequent and regular administration is associated with tolerance and physical dependence .
internationally , diacetylmorphine is controlled under schedules i and iv of the single convention on narcotic drugs .
it is illegal to manufacture , possess , or sell diacetylmorphine without a license in almost every country .
under the chemical names diamorphine and diacetylmorphine , heroin is a legally prescribed controlled drug in the united kingdom , and is supplied in tablet or injectable form for the same indications as morphine is , often being preferred over
it is also available for prescription to long-term users as a form of opioid replacement therapy in the netherlands , united kingdom , switzerland , germany , and denmark , alongside psycho-social care —in the same manner that methadone or
typical tropical savanna in northern australia demonstrating the high tree density and regular spacing characteristic of many savannas .
a savanna , or savannah , is a grassland ecosystem characterized by the trees being sufficiently widely spaced so that the canopy does not close .
the open canopy allows sufficient light to reach the ground to support an unbroken herbaceous layer consisting primarily of grasses .
some classification systems also recognize a grassland savanna from which trees are absent .
this article deals only with savanna under the common definition of a grassy woodland with a significant woody plant component .
it is often believed that savannas feature widely spaced , scattered trees .
however , in many savannas , tree densities are higher and trees are more regularly spaced than in forest .
savannas are also characterized by seasonal water availability , with the majority of rainfall confined to one season .
savannas are associated with several types of biomes .
savannas are frequently in a transitional zone between forest and desert or grassland .
savanna covers approximately 20 % of the earth 's land area .
the high jump is a track and field athletics event in which competitors must jump over a horizontal bar placed at measured heights without the aid of certain devices .
in its modern most practiced format , auxiliary weights and mounds have been used for assistance ; rules have changed over the years .
over the centuries since , competitors have introduced increasingly more effective techniques to arrive at the current form .
javier sotomayor ( cuba ) is the current men 's record holder with a jump of set in 1993 , the longest standing record in the history of the men 's high jump .
stefka kostadinova ( bulgaria ) has held the women 's world record at since 1987 , also the longest-held record in the event .
stingrays are a group of rays , which are cartilaginous fishes related to sharks .
they are classified in the suborder myliobatoidei of the order myliobatiformes , and consist of eight families : hexatrygonidae ( sixgill stingray ) , plesiobatidae ( deep water stingray ) , urolophidae ( stingarees ) , urotrygonidae ( round rays
most stingrays have one or more barbed stings ( modified from dermal denticles ) on the tail , which are used exclusively in self-defense .
the stinger may reach a length of approximately , and its underside has two grooves with venom glands .
the stinger is covered with a thin layer of skin , the integumentary sheath , in which the venom is concentrated .
a few members of the suborder , such as the manta rays and the porcupine ray , do not have stingers .
stingrays are common in coastal tropical and subtropical marine waters throughout the world , and also includes species found in warmer temperate oceans , such as dasyatis thetidis , and those found in the deep ocean , such as plesiobatis
the river stingrays , and a number of whiptail stingrays ( such as the niger stingray ) , are restricted to fresh water .
most myliobatoids are demersal , but some , such as the pelagic stingray and the eagle rays , are pelagic .
while most stingrays are relatively widespread and not currently threatened , for several species ( for example taeniura meyeni , d. colarensis , d. garouaensis , and d. laosensis ) , the conservation status is more problematic , leading to
the status of several other species are poorly known , leading to them being listed as data deficient .

the miami marlins are a professional baseball team based in miami , florida and a member of the eastern division of major league baseball ( mlb 's ) national league .
their home park is marlins park .
the miami marlins began play in the 1993 season as the florida marlins .
they played home games from their inaugural season to the 2011 season at sun life stadium , which they shared with the miami dolphins of the national football league ( nfl ) and which was also called joe robbie stadium
beginning with the 2012 major league baseball season , they play at marlins park in downtown miami , on the site of the former orange bowl .
the new park , unlike sun life stadium ( which was criticized in its baseball configuration for poor sight lines in some locations ) , was designed foremost as a baseball park .
the new park 's name is a temporary one until naming rights are purchased .
per agreement with the city and miami-dade county ( which owns the park ) , the marlins officially changed their name to the `` miami marlins '' on november 11 , 2011 .
they also adopted a new logo , color scheme , and uniforms .
the marlins have the distinction of winning a world series championship every year they qualified for the postseason , doing so in 1997 and 2003 — both times as the national league wild card team .
they defeated the american league champion cleveland indians in the 1997 series , which was notable for shortstop edgar rentería driving in second baseman craig counsell for the series-clinching run in the eleventh inning of the seventh and deciding game
the 2003 season was notable for the firing of manager jeff torborg after thirty-eight games .
the marlins were in last place in the national league east with a 16-22 record at the time .
torborg 's successor , 72-year-old jack mckeon , led them to the national league 's wild card berth in the playoffs ; they defeated the new york yankees four games to two in the 2003 world series .
the bible has been translated into many languages from the biblical languages of hebrew , aramaic and greek .
the full bible has been translated into 518 languages , and 2798 languages have at least some portion of the bible .

since then , the bible has been translated into many more languages .
english bible translations in particular have a rich and varied history of more than a millennium .
diagnosis-related group ( drg ) is a system to classify hospital cases into one of originally 467 groups .
the 467th group was `` ungroupable '' .
this system of classification was developed as a collaborative project by robert b fetter , phd , of the yale school of management , and john d thompson , mph , of the yale school of public health .
the system is also referred to as `` the drgs '' , and its intent was to identify the `` products '' that a hospital provides .
one example of a `` product '' is an appendectomy .
the system was developed in anticipation of convincing congress to use it for reimbursement , to replace `` cost based '' reimbursement that had been used up to that point .
drgs are assigned by a `` grouper '' program based on icd ( international classification of diseases ) diagnoses , procedures , age , sex , discharge status , and the presence of complications or comorbidities .
drgs have been used in the us since 1982 to determine how much medicare pays the hospital for each `` product '' , since patients within each category are clinically similar and are expected to use the same level of
drgs may be further grouped into major diagnostic categories ( mdcs ) .
drgs are also standard practice for establishing reimbursements for other medicare related reimbursements such as to home healthcare providers .
deliverable is a term used in project management to describe a tangible or intangible object produced as a result of the project that is intended to be delivered to a customer ( either internal or external ) .
a deliverable could be a report , a document , a server upgrade or any other building block of an overall project .
a deliverable may be composed of multiple smaller deliverables .
it may be either an outcome to be achieved ( as in `` the corporation says that becoming profitable this year is a deliverable. '' ) or an output to be provided ( as in `` the deliverable for the
a deliverable differs from a project milestone in that a milestone is a measurement of progress toward an output whereas the deliverable is the result of the process .
for a typical project , a milestone might be the completion of a product design while the deliverable might be the technical diagram of the product .
a deliverable also differs from a project document in that project document is typically part of a project deliverable , or a project deliverable may contain number of documents and physical things .
in technical projects , deliverables can further be classified as hardware , software , or design documents .
in contracted efforts , deliverable may refer to an item specifically required by contract documents , such as an item on a contract data requirements list or mentioned in the statement of work .
a googol is the large number 10100 ; that is , the digit 1 followed by 100 zeroes :
1 , ­000 , ­000 , ­000 , ­000 , ­000 , ­000 , ­000 , ­000 , ­000 , ­000 , ­000 , ­000 , ­000 , ­000 , ­000 , ­000 , ­000 , ­000 , ­000 ,
the term was coined in 1938 by 9-year-old milton sirotta , nephew of american mathematician edward kasner .
kasner popularized the concept in his 1940 book mathematics and the imagination .
other names for googol include ten duotrigintillion on the short scale , ten thousand sexdecillion on the long scale , or ten sexdecilliard on the peletier long scale .
a googol has no particular significance in mathematics , but is useful when comparing with other very large quantities such as the number of subatomic particles in the visible universe or the number of hypothetically possible chess games .
edward kasner used it to illustrate the difference between an unimaginably large number and infinity , and in this role it is sometimes used in teaching mathematics .
a googol is approximately 70 !
( factorial of 70 ) .
in the binary numeral system , one would need 333 bits to represent a googol , i.e. , 1 googol ≈ 2332.19 , or exactly .
this number is notable for being the subject of the £1 million question in the infamous episode of who wants to be a millionaire ?
, when contestant charles ingram cheated his way through the show by getting help from his wife diana , who was in the audience , and fellow contestant tecwen whittock .
it is also the namesake of the internet company google , with the name `` google '' being a misspelling of `` googol '' by the company 's founders .
1 googol ( 1e100 ) is a small fraction more , than the biggest number a usual hand-held calculator can display and handle , which is 9.999 ...
x10e99 in scientific notation with a two-digits exponent .
69 !
can usually be calculated , but not 70 ! .

the menstrual cycle is the scientific term for the physiological changes that occur in fertile women and other female primates for the purposes of sexual reproduction .
this article focuses on the human menstrual cycle , a `` monthly '' cycle that can vary around an average of ~28 days per cycle .
the menstrual cycle , under the control of the endocrine system , is necessary for reproduction .
it is commonly divided into three phases : the follicular phase , ovulation , and the luteal phase .
it is also occasionally misclassified using the uterine cycle : menstruation , proliferative phase , and secretory phase .
menstrual cycles are counted from the first day of menstrual bleeding .
hormonal contraception interferes with the normal hormonal changes with the aim of preventing reproduction .
stimulated by gradually increasing amounts of estrogen in the follicular phase , discharges of blood ( menses ) slow then stop , and the lining of the uterus thickens .
follicles in the ovary begin developing under the influence of a complex interplay of hormones , and after several days one or occasionally two become dominant ( non-dominant follicles atrophy and die ) .
approximately mid-cycle , 24–36 hours after the luteinizing hormone ( lh ) surges , the dominant follicle releases an ovum , or egg in an event called ovulation .
after ovulation , the egg only lives for 24 hours or less without fertilization while the remains of the dominant follicle in the ovary become a corpus luteum ; this body has a primary function of producing large amounts of
under the influence of progesterone , the endometrium ( uterine lining ) changes to prepare for potential implantation of an embryo to establish a pregnancy .
if implantation does not occur within approximately two weeks , the corpus luteum will involute , causing sharp drops in levels of both progesterone and estrogen .
these hormone drops cause the uterus to shed its lining and egg in a process termed menstruation .
in the menstrual cycle , changes occur in the female reproductive system as well as other systems ( which lead to breast tenderness or mood changes , for example ) .
a woman 's first menstruation is termed menarche , and occurs typically around age 12-13 .
the end of a woman 's reproductive phase is called the menopause , which commonly occurs somewhere between the ages of 45 and 55 .

the music of star wars consists of the scores written for all six star wars films by composer john williams from 1977 to 1983 for the original trilogy , and 1999 to 2005 for the prequel trilogy .
williams ' scores for the double trilogy count among the most widely known and popular contributions to modern film music .
additionally , music for star wars : the clone wars was written by kevin kiner , and further music has been composed for star wars video games and works in other media .
the scores utilize an eclectic variety of musical styles , many culled from the late romantic idiom of richard strauss and his contemporaries that itself was incorporated into the golden age hollywood scores of erich korngold and max steiner .
while several obvious nods to gustav holst , william walton and igor stravinsky exist in the score to episode iv , williams relied less and less on classical references in the latter five scores , incorporating more strains of modernist
the reasons for williams ' tapping of a familiar romantic idiom are known to involve lucas ' desire to ground the otherwise strange and fantastic setting in well-known , audience-accessible music .
indeed , lucas maintains much of the trilogy 's success relies not on advanced visual effects , but on the simple , direct emotional appeal of its plot , characters and , importantly , music .
star wars often is credited as heralding the beginning of a revival of grand symphonic scores in the late 1970s .
one technique in particular is an influence : williams 's revival of a technique called leitmotif , which is most famously associated with the operas of richard wagner and , in film scores , with steiner .
a leitmotif is a phrase or melodic cell that signifies a character , place , plot element , mood , idea , relationship or other specific part of the film .
it commonly is used in modern film scoring as a device for mentally anchoring certain parts of a film to the soundtrack .
of chief importance for a leitmotif is that it must be strong enough for a listener to latch onto while being flexible enough to undergo variation and development .
a series of concerts which featured star wars music , star wars : in concert , took place in 2009 and 2010 .
first performed in london , it went on to tour across the united states and canada , last playing at london , ontario , canada on july 25 , 2010 .

the country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the pacific and the caribbean .
at 3.79 million square miles ( 9.83 million km2 ) and with around 315 million people , the united states is the third- or fourth-largest country by total area and the third-largest by both land area and population .
it is one of the world 's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations , the product of large-scale immigration from many countries .
the geography and climate of the u.s. is also extremely diverse , with deserts , plains , forests , and mountains that are home to a wide variety of species .
paleoindians migrated from asia to what is now the united states mainland around 15,000 years ago .
after 1500 , old world diseases introduced by europeans greatly reduced their populations .
european colonization began around 1600 and came mostly from england .
the united states emerged from thirteen british colonies located along the atlantic seaboard .
disputes between great britain and the american colonies led to the american revolution .
on july 4 , 1776 , delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the declaration of independence , which established the united states of america .
the american revolutionary war , which ended with the recognition of independence of the united states from the kingdom of great britain , was the first successful war of independence against a european colonial empire .
the current constitution was adopted on september 17 , 1787 ; twenty-seven amendments have since been added to the constitution .
the first ten amendments , collectively named the bill of rights , were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms .
driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny , the united states embarked on a vigorous expansion across north america throughout the 19th century .
this involved displacing native tribes , acquiring new territories , and gradually admitting new states .
the american civil war ended legalized slavery in the united states .
by the end of the nineteenth century , the united states extended into the pacific ocean , and its economy was the world 's largest .

the per capita gdp of the u.s. was the world 's sixth-highest as of 2010 , although america 's wealth inequality was also ranked highest among oecd countries by the world bank .
the economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources , a well-developed infrastructure , and high productivity ; and while its economy is considered post-industrial it continues to be one of the world 's largest manufacturers .
the country accounts for 39 % of global military spending , and is a leading economic , political , and cultural force in the world , as well as a leader in scientific research and technological innovation .
in astronomy , the circumpolar constellations are constellations that never set from the viewer 's perspective .
considered a very important effect in astronomy , it is different from seasonal constellations .
circumpolar constellations stay in the sky .
because of the rotation of the earth and its orbit around the sun , we divide the stars and constellations into two groups .
some stars and constellations never rise nor set , and they are called circumpolar .
all the rest are divided into seasonal stars and constellations .
which stars and constellations will be circumpolar and which seasonal depends on your latitude .
in the northern hemisphere , we will always be able to see stars and constellations in the northern circumpolar sky , while in the southern hemisphere , we will always be able to see stars and constellations in the southern
the celestial north pole , currently marked by polaris , always has an azimuth equal to zero .
also , its altitude for a given place is fixed and its value is given by the following formula : a = 90-ø .
all stars with a declination less than a are not circumpolar .
they are also visible year round at that location .
from the north pole , all constellations north of the celestial equator , ( all fully visible constellations ) are circumpolar , and similarly from the south pole .
from the equator , there are no circumpolar constellations .
from mid-north latitudes ( 40–50°n ) , circumpolar constellations may include ursa major , ursa minor , draco , cepheus , cassiopeia and the not well known camelopardalis .
same-sex marriage is legally recognized in several jurisdictions within the united states .

in addition , california , which briefly granted same-sex marriages in 2008 , now recognizes them on a conditional basis .
while several jurisdictions have legalized same-sex marriage through court rulings , legislative action , and popular vote , nine states prohibit same-sex marriage by statute and 30 prohibit it in their constitutions .
the defense of marriage act ( doma ) , enacted in 1996 , prevents the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages and allows each state to refuse recognition of same-sex marriages performed in other states .
the provision of doma forbidding the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages has been found unconstitutional in eight federal courts , including two federal appeals courts .
five of these cases are pending review by the supreme court .
the movement to obtain marriage rights and benefits for same-sex couples in the united states began in the 1970s , but became more prominent in u.s. politics in 1993 when the hawaii supreme court declared the state 's prohibition to

the 18th century lasted from january 1 , 1701 to december 31 , 1800 in the gregorian calendar .
during the 18th century , the enlightenment culminated in the french and american revolutions .
philosophy and science increased in prominence .
philosophers dreamed of a brighter age .
this dream turned into a reality with the french revolution , although it was later compromised by excess of the terror of maximilien robespierre .
at first , the monarchies of europe embraced enlightenment ideals , but with the french revolution they feared losing their power and joined wide coalitions with the counter-revolution .
the ottoman empire was undergoing a protracted decline , as it failed to keep up with the technological advances in europe .
the tulip period symbolized a period of peace and reorientation towards european society , after victory against a burgeoning russian empire in the pruth river campaign .
throughout the century various reforms were introduced with limited success .
the 18th century also marked the end of the polish–lithuanian commonwealth as an independent state .
the once powerful and vast kingdom , that was once able to conquer moscow and defeat the great ottoman armies , collapsed under numerous invasions .
its semi-democratic government system was not efficient enough to rival the neighbouring monarchies of prussia , russia and austria who divided the commonwealth territories among them , changing the landscape of central european politics for the next hundred years .
great britain became a major power worldwide with the defeat of france in the americas , in the 1760s and the conquest of large parts of india .
however , britain lost much of its north american colonies after the american revolution , which was actively helped by the french .
the industrial revolution started in britain around 1770s with the production of the improved steam engine .
despite its modest beginnings in the 18th century , it would radically change human society and the environment .
western historians have occasionally defined the 18th century otherwise for the purposes of their work .
for example , the `` short '' 18th century may be defined as 1715–1789 , denoting the period of time between the death of louis xiv of france and the start of the french revolution with an emphasis on directly
to historians who expand the century to include larger historical movements , the `` long '' 18th century may run from the glorious revolution of 1688 to the battle of waterloo in 1815 or even later .
the eiffel tower ( , ) is an iron lattice tower located on the champ de mars in paris , named after the engineer gustave eiffel , whose company designed and built the tower .
erected in 1889 as the entrance arch to the 1889 world 's fair , it has become both a global cultural icon of france and one of the most recognizable structures in the world .
the tower is the tallest structure in paris and the most-visited paid monument in the world ; 7.1 million people ascended it in 2011 .
the third level observatory 's upper platform is at the highest accessible to public in the european union and the highest in europe as long as the platform of the ostankino tower , at , remains closed as a result
the tower received its 250 millionth visitor in 2010 .
the tower stands tall , about the same height as an 81-storey building .
during its construction , the eiffel tower surpassed the washington monument to assume the title of the tallest man-made structure in the world , a title it held for 41 years , until the chrysler building in new york city
because of the addition , in 1957 , of the antenna atop the eiffel tower , it is now taller than the chrysler building .
not including broadcast antennas , it is the second-tallest structure in france , after the millau viaduct .
the tower has three levels for visitors .
tickets can be purchased to ascend , by stairs or lift ( elevator ) , to the first and second levels .
the walk from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps , as is the walk from the first to the second level .
the third and highest level is accessible only by lift—stairs do exist but are usually closed to the public .
the first and second levels have restaurants .
the tower has become the most prominent symbol of both paris and france , often in the establishing shot of films set in the city .

spiders ( order araneae ) are air-breathing arthropods that have eight legs and chelicerae with fangs that inject venom .
they are the largest order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all other groups of organisms .
spiders are found worldwide on every continent except for antarctica , and have become established in nearly every habitat with the exception of air and sea colonization .
as of 2008 , at least 43,678 spider species , and 109 families have been recorded by taxonomists ; however , there has been confusion within the scientific community as to how all these families should be classified , as
anatomically , spiders differ from other arthropods in that the usual body segments are fused into two tagmata , the cephalothorax and abdomen , and joined by a small , cylindrical pedicel .
unlike insects , spiders do not have antennae .
in all except the most primitive group , the mesothelae , spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods , as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax .
unlike most arthropods , spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure .
their abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of silk glands within their abdomen .
spider webs vary widely in size , shape and the amount of sticky thread used .
it now appears that the spiral orb web may be one of the earliest forms , and spiders that produce tangled cobwebs are more abundant and diverse than orb-web spiders .
spider-like arachnids with silk-producing spigots appeared in the devonian period about , but these animals apparently lacked spinnerets .
true spiders have been found in carboniferous rocks from , and are very similar to the most primitive surviving order , the mesothelae .
the main groups of modern spiders , mygalomorphae and araneomorphae , first appeared in the triassic period , before .
a herbivorous species , bagheera kiplingi , was described in 2008 , but all other known species are predators , mostly preying on insects and on other spiders , although a few large species also take birds and lizards .
spiders use a wide range of strategies to capture prey : trapping it in sticky webs , lassoing it with sticky bolas , mimicking the prey to avoid detection , or running it down .
most detect prey mainly by sensing vibrations , but the active hunters have acute vision , and hunters of the genus portia show signs of intelligence in their choice of tactics and ability to develop new ones .
spiders ' guts are too narrow to take solids , and they liquidize their food by flooding it with digestive enzymes and grinding it with the bases of their pedipalps , as they do not have true jaws .
male spiders identify themselves by a variety of complex courtship rituals to avoid being eaten by the females .
males of most species survive a few matings , limited mainly by their short life spans .
females weave silk egg-cases , each of which may contain hundreds of eggs .
females of many species care for their young , for example by carrying them around or by sharing food with them .
a minority of species are social , building communal webs that may house anywhere from a few to 50,000 individuals .
social behavior ranges from precarious toleration , as in the widow spiders , to co-operative hunting and food-sharing .
although most spiders live for at most two years , tarantulas and other mygalomorph spiders can live up to 25 years in captivity .
while the venom of a few species is dangerous to humans , scientists are now researching the use of spider venom in medicine and as non-polluting pesticides .
spider silk provides a combination of lightness , strength and elasticity that is superior to that of synthetic materials , and spider silk genes have been inserted into mammals and plants to see if these can be used as silk
as a result of their wide range of behaviors , spiders have become common symbols in art and mythology symbolizing various combinations of patience , cruelty and creative powers .
the eucharist displayed in a monstrance , flanked by candles being adored by a kneeling altar server .
eucharistic adoration is a practice in the roman catholic church , and in a few anglican and lutheran churches , in which the blessed sacrament is exposed and adored by the faithful .
adoration is a sign of devotion to and worship of jesus christ , who is believed by catholics to be present body , blood , soul , and divinity , under the appearance of the consecrated host , in the
as a devotion , eucharistic adoration and meditation are more than merely looking at the blessed host , but are believed to be a continuation of what was celebrated in the eucharist .
from a theological perspective , the adoration is a form of latria , based on the tenet of the presence of christ in the blessed host .
christian meditation performed in the presence of the eucharist outside of mass is called eucharistic meditation .
it has been practiced by such as peter julian eymard , jean vianney and thérèse of lisieux .
authors such as the venerable concepcion cabrera de armida and blessed maria candida of the eucharist have produced large volumes of text based on their eucharistic meditations .
when the exposure and adoration of the eucharist is constant ( twenty-four hours a day ) , it is called perpetual adoration .
in a monastery or convent , it is done by the resident monks or nuns and , in a parish , by volunteer parishioners since the 20th century .
in the opening prayer of the perpetual chapel in st. peter basilica pope john paul ii prayed for a perpetual adoration chapel in every parish in the world .
pope benedict xvi instituted perpetual adoration for the laity in each of the five sectors of the diocese of rome .

elephants are large mammals of the family elephantidae and the order proboscidea .
traditionally , two species are recognised , the african elephant ( loxodonta africana ) and the asian elephant ( elephas maximus ) , although some evidence suggests that african bush elephants and african forest elephants are separate species ( l.
elephants are scattered throughout sub-saharan africa , and south and southeast asia .
they are the only surviving proboscideans ; extinct species include mammoths and mastodons .
the largest living terrestrial animals , male african elephants can reach a height of and weigh .
these animals have several distinctive features , including a long proboscis or trunk used for many purposes , particularly for grasping objects .
their incisors grow into tusks , which serve as tools for moving objects and digging and as weapons for fighting .
the elephant 's large ear flaps help to control the temperature of its body .
african elephants have larger ears and concave backs while asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs .
elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs , forests , deserts and marshes .
they prefer to stay near water .
they are considered to be keystone species due to their impact on their environments .
other animals tend to keep their distance , and predators such as lions , tigers , hyenas and wild dogs usually target only the young elephants ( or `` calves '' ) .
females ( or `` cows '' ) tend to live in family groups , which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring .
the latter are led by the oldest cow , known as the matriarch .
elephants have a fission-fusion society in which multiple family groups come together to socialise .
males ( or `` bulls '' ) leave their family groups when they reach puberty , and may live alone or with other males .
adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth , which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success .
calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years .
elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild .
they communicate by touch , sight , and sound ; elephants use infrasound , and seismic communication over long distances .
elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans .
they appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind .
african elephants are listed as vulnerable by the international union for conservation of nature ( iucn ) , while the asian elephant is classed as endangered .
one of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade , as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks .
other threats to wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people .
elephants are used as working animals in asia .
in the past they were used in war ; today , they are often put on display in zoos and circuses .
elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in art , folklore , religion , literature and popular culture .

the petit le mans ( french for little le mans ) is a sports car endurance race held annually at road atlanta in braselton , georgia , usa .
it uses the rules established for the 24 hours of le mans by the automobile club de l'ouest ( aco ) , which are slightly modified if necessary , mainly to allow additional cars to compete .
the race was founded by road atlanta owner don panoz and first run on october 10 , 1998 as part of the imsa season .
the 1999 edition was one of the original events of the american le mans series .
the 2010 and 2011 editions were also part of the intercontinental le mans cup , but the 2012 race for the brand-new world endurance championship was dropped in favour of bahrain .
this caused a lot of controversy after the calendar was published .
the petit le mans covers a maximum of ( which is approximately 394 laps ) or a maximum of 10 hours , whichever comes first ; only once , in the rain-stopped 2009 race , has the leading team failed
in addition to the overall race , teams of two or three drivers per car compete for class victories in different categories , divided into le mans prototypes and grand tourers .
class winners of this event receive an automatic invitation to the following year 's 24 hours of le mans , however in 2012 this was removed from the regulations .
rinaldo capello holds the record of most race wins , having won in 2000 , 2002 , 2006 , 2007 and 2008 .

is a function from domain x to codomain y .
the smaller oval inside y is the image of .
sometimes `` range '' refers to the codomain and sometimes to the image .
in mathematics , the range of a function refers to either the codomain or the image of the function , depending upon usage .
the codomain is a set containing the function 's output , whereas the image is only the part of the codomain where the elements are outputs of the function .
for example , the function is often described as a function from the real numbers to the real numbers , meaning that the codomain is r , but its image is the set of non-negative real numbers .
some books say that range of this function is its codomain , the set of all real numbers , reflecting that the function is real-valued .
these books call the actual output of the function the image .
this is the current usage for range in computer science .
other books say that the range is the function 's image , the set of non-negative real numbers , reflecting that a number can be the output of this function if and only if it is a non-negative real number
in this case , the larger set containing the range is called the codomain .
this usage is more common in modern mathematics .

the fundamental theorem of calculus is a theorem that links the concept of the derivative of a function with the concept of the integral .
the first part of the theorem , sometimes called the first fundamental theorem of calculus , shows that an indefinite integration can be reversed by a differentiation .
this part of the theorem is also important because it guarantees the existence of antiderivatives for continuous functions .
the second part , sometimes called the second fundamental theorem of calculus , allows one to compute the definite integral of a function by using any one of its infinitely many antiderivatives .
this part of the theorem has invaluable practical applications , because it markedly simplifies the computation of definite integrals .
the first published statement and proof of a restricted version of the fundamental theorem was by james gregory ( 1638–1675 ) .
isaac barrow ( 1630–1677 ) proved a more generalized version of the theorem while barrow 's student isaac newton ( 1643–1727 ) completed the development of the surrounding mathematical theory .
gottfried leibniz ( 1646–1716 ) systematized the knowledge into a calculus for infinitesimal quantities and introduced the notation used today .

sermon on the mount by carl bloch
the sermon on the mount ( anglicized from the matthean vulgate latin section title : sermo in monte ) is a collection of sayings and teachings of jesus , which emphasizes his moral teaching found in the gospel of matthew
it is the first of the five discourses of matthew and takes place relatively early in the ministry of jesus after he has been baptized by john the baptist and preached in galilee .
the sermon is the longest piece of teaching from jesus in the new testament , and has been one of the most widely quoted elements of the canonical gospels .
it includes some of the best known teachings of jesus , such as the beatitudes , and the widely recited lord 's prayer .
to most believers in jesus , the sermon on the mount contains the central tenets of christian discipleship .
the last verse of chapter 5 is considered to be a focal point that summarizes the teaching of the sermon : `` be perfect , as your heavenly father is perfect '' , advising his disciples and followers to seek

the first officially recorded oaths of allegiance were made on may 30 , 1778 at valley forge , during the revolutionary war .
soldiers , sailors , and marines state the oath of allegiance at a citizenship ceremony at camp liberty , iraq in 2009
the current oath is as follows :
in some cases , the united states bureau of citizenship and immigration services ( cis ) allows the oath to be taken without the clauses regarding the bearing of arms and performance of noncombatant military service .
provides that the phrase `` so help me god '' is optional and that the words ‘on oath’ can be substituted with ‘and solemnly affirm’ .
also , if the prospective citizen can prove such commitments are in violation with his or her religion , the lines `` that i will bear arms on behalf of the united states when required by law ; that i
the current exact text of the oath of citizenship is established only in the form of an administrative regulation promulgated by the executive branch .
however , under the administrative procedure act , cis could theoretically change the text of the oath at any time , so long as the new text reasonably meets the `` five principles '' mandated by the immigration and nationality
these principles are :
allegiance to the united states constitution ,
renunciation of allegiance to any foreign country to which the immigrant has had previous allegiances
defense of the constitution against enemies `` foreign and domestic ''
promise to serve in the united states armed forces when required by law ( either combat or non-combat )
promise to perform civilian duties of `` national importance '' when required by law
there has been some controversy about the wording of the oath , parts of which are based on the british oath of supremacy which was written in the 16th century .
as a result , some have suggested much of the language is antiquated and confusing .
in the fall of 2003 , cis planned to change the oath of citizenship in time for citizenship day ( september 17 ) .
the proposed oath was as followed :
the introduction of the new oath was scrapped by the u.s. house of representatives judiciary subcommittee on immigration , border security , and claims on april 1 , 2004 .

the tacoma narrows bridge is a pair of twin suspension bridges that span the tacoma narrows strait of puget sound in pierce county , washington .
the bridges connects the city of tacoma with the kitsap peninsula and carry state route 16 ( known as primary state highway 14 until 1964 ) over the strait .

engineering issues as well as the united states ' involvement in world war ii postponed plans to replace the bridge for several years ; the replacement bridge was opened on october 14 , 1950 .
by 1990 , population growth and development on the kitsap peninsula caused traffic on the bridge to exceed its design capacity ; as a result , in 1998 washington voters approved a measure to support building a parallel bridge .
after a series of protests and court battles , construction began in 2002 and the new bridge opened to carry eastbound traffic on july 15 , 2007 , while the 1950 bridge was reconfigured to carry westbound traffic .
at the time of their construction , both the 1940 and 1950 bridges were the third-longest suspension bridges in the world in terms of main span length , behind the golden gate bridge and george washington bridge .
the 1950 and 2007 bridges are now the fifth-longest suspension bridge spans in the united states , and the 31st-longest in the world .
tolls were charged on the bridge for the entire four-month service life of the original span , as well as the first 15 years of the 1950 bridge .
in 1965 , the bridge 's construction bonds plus interest were paid off , and the state ceased toll collection on the bridge .
over 40 years later , tolls were reinstated as part of the financing of the twin span , and are presently collected only from vehicles traveling eastbound .

democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in the decisions that affect their lives .
democracy allows eligible citizens to participate equally—either directly or through elected representatives—in the proposal , development , and creation of laws .
it encompasses social , economic and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination .
the term originates from the greek ( ' ) `` rule of the people '' , which was coined from δῆμος ( dêmos ) `` people '' and κράτος ( kratos ) `` power '' or `` rule '' in
while theoretically these definitions are in opposition , in practice the distinction has been blurred historically .
the political system of classical athens , for example , granted democratic citizenship to an elite class of free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation .
in virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history , democratic citizenship consisted of an elite class until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th
the english word dates to the 16th century , from the older middle french and middle latin equivalents .
a democratic government contrasts to forms of government where power is either held by one , as in a monarchy , or where power is held by a small number of individuals , as in an oligarchy .
nevertheless , these oppositions , inherited from greek philosophy , are now ambiguous because contemporary governments have mixed democratic , oligarchic , and monarchic elements .
karl popper defined democracy in contrast to dictatorship or tyranny , thus focusing on opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a revolution .
several variants of democracy exist , but there are two basic forms , both of which concern how the whole body of all eligible citizens executes its will .
one form of democracy is direct democracy , in which all eligible citizens have direct and active participation in the decision making of the government .
in most modern democracies , the whole body of all eligible citizens remain the sovereign power but political power is exercised indirectly through elected representatives ; this is called representative democracy .
the concept of representative democracy arose largely from ideas and institutions that developed during the european middle ages , the age of enlightenment , and the american and french revolutions .

the roller coaster is a popular amusement ride developed for amusement parks and modern theme parks .
lamarcus adna thompson obtained a patent regarding roller coasters on january 20 , 1885 , which were made out of wood , but this patent is considerably later than the `` russian mountains '' described below .
in essence a specialized railroad system , a roller coaster consists of a track that rises in designed patterns , sometimes with one or more inversions ( such as vertical loops ) that briefly turn the rider upside down .
the track does not necessarily have to be a complete circuit , as shuttle roller coasters demonstrate .
most roller coasters have multiple cars in which passengers sit and are restrained .
two or more cars hooked together are called a train .
some roller coasters , notably wild mouse roller coasters , run with single cars .
martin luther ( ; 10 november 1483 – 18 february 1546 ) was a german monk , former catholic priest , professor of theology and seminal figure of a reform movement in sixteenth century christianity , subsequently known as the
he strongly disputed the claim that freedom from god 's punishment for sin could be purchased with money .
he confronted indulgence salesman johann tetzel with his ninety-five theses in 1517 .
his refusal to retract all of his writings at the demand of pope leo x in 1520 and the holy roman emperor charles v at the diet of worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the pope and condemnation
luther taught that salvation is not earned by good deeds but received only as a free gift of god 's grace through faith in jesus christ as redeemer from sin .
his theology challenged the authority of the pope of the roman catholic church by teaching that the bible is the only source of divinely revealed knowledge and opposed sacerdotalism by considering all baptized christians to be a holy priesthood .
those who identify with luther 's teachings are called lutherans .
his translation of the bible into the vernacular ( instead of latin ) made it more accessible , which had a tremendous impact on the church and on german culture .
it fostered the development of a standard version of the german language , added several principles to the art of translation , and influenced the writing of an english translation , the king james bible .
his hymns influenced the development of singing in churches .
his marriage to katharina von bora set a model for the practice of clerical marriage , allowing protestant priests to marry .
in his later years , in deteriorating health , luther became increasingly antisemitic , writing that jewish homes should be destroyed , their synagogues burned , money confiscated and liberty curtailed .
these statements have contributed to his controversial status .
wellness is generally used to mean a healthy balance of the mind , body and spirit that results in an overall feeling of well-being .
it has been used in the context of alternative medicine since halbert l. dunn , m.d. , began using the phrase high level wellness in the 1950s .
the modern concept of wellness did not , however , become popular until the 1970s .
the term has been defined by the wisconsin-based national wellness institute as an active process of becoming aware of and making choices toward a more successful existence .
url_http this is consistent with a shift in focus away from illness in viewing human health , typical of contexts where the term wellness is used .
in other words , wellness is a view of health that emphasizes the state of the entire being and its ongoing development .
the phrase can also be seen as an analogue to the medical term `` homeostasis `` .
wellness can also be described as `` the constant , conscious pursuit of living life to its fullest potential . ''
halbert l. dunn , m.d. , began using the phrase high level wellness in the 1950s , based on a series of lectures at a unitarian universalist church in arlington , virginia , in the united states .
dunn ( 196 , p. 4 ) defined wellness as `` an integrated method of functioning which is oriented toward maximizing the potential of which the individual is capable .
it requires that the individual maintain a continuum of balance and purposeful direction within the environment where he is functioning . ''
he also stated that `` wellness is a direction in progress toward an ever-higher potential of functioning '' ( p. 6 ) .
alternative approaches to wellness are often denoted by the use of two different phrases : health and wellness , and wellness programs .
these kinds of wellness programs offer alternative medicine techniques to improve wellness .
whether these techniques actually improve physical health is controversial and a subject of much debate .
james randi and the james randi educational foundation are outspoken critics of this alternative new age concept of wellness .
the behaviors in the pursuit of wellness often include many health related practices , such as natural therapies .
wellness , as a luxury pursuit , is found obviously in the more affluent societies because it involves managing the body state after the basic needs of food , shelter and basic medical care have already been met .
many of the practices applied in the pursuit of wellness , in fact , are aimed at controlling the side effects of affluence , such as obesity and inactivity .
wellness grew as a popular concept starting in the 19th century , just as the middle class began emerging in the industrialized world , and a time when a newly prosperous public had the time and the resources to pursue
the moons of saturn ( also known as the natural satellites of saturn ) are numerous and diverse ranging from tiny moonlets less than 1 kilometer across to the enormous titan which is larger than the planet mercury .
saturn has 62 moons with confirmed orbits , 53 of which have names and only 13 of which have diameters larger than 50 kilometers .
saturn has seven moons that are large enough to be ellipsoidal due to having planetary mass , as well as dense rings with complex orbital motions of their own .
particularly notable among saturn 's moons are titan , the second- largest moon in the solar system , with a nitrogen-rich earth-like atmosphere and a landscape including hydrocarbon lakes and dry river networks ; and enceladus , which emits jets
twenty-four of saturn 's moons are regular satellites ; they have prograde orbits not greatly inclined to saturn 's equatorial plane .
they include the seven major satellites , four small moons which exist in a trojan orbit with larger moons , two mutually co-orbital moons and two moons which act as shepherds of saturn 's f ring .
two other known regular satellites orbit within gaps in saturn 's rings .
the relatively large hyperion is locked in a resonance with titan .
the remaining regular moons orbit near the outer edge of the a ring , within g ring and between the major moons mimas and enceladus .
the regular satellites are traditionally named after titans and titanesses or other figures associated with the mythological saturn .
the remaining 38 , all small except one , are irregular satellites , whose orbits are much farther from saturn , have high inclinations , and are mixed between prograde and retrograde .
these moons are probably captured minor planets , or debris from the breakup of such bodies after they were captured , creating collisional families .
the irregular satellites have been classified by their orbital characteristics into the inuit , norse , and gallic groups , and their names are chosen from the corresponding mythologies .
the largest of the irregular moons is phoebe , the ninth moon of saturn , and was discovered at the end of the 19th century .
the rings of saturn are made up of objects ranging in size from microscopic to hundreds of meters , each of which is on its own orbit about the planet .
thus a precise number of saturnian moons can not be given , as there is no objective boundary between the countless small anonymous objects that form saturn 's ring system and the larger objects that have been named as moons
at least 150 moonlets embedded in the rings have been detected by the disturbance they create in the surrounding ring material , though this is thought to be only a small sample of the total population of such objects .

atherosclerosis ( also known as arteriosclerotic vascular disease or asvd ) is a condition in which an artery wall thickens as a result of the accumulation of fatty materials such as cholesterol and triglyceride .
it is a syndrome affecting arterial blood vessels , a chronic inflammatory response in the walls of arteries , caused largely by the accumulation of macrophage white blood cells and promoted by low-density lipoproteins ( ldl , plasma proteins that
it is commonly referred to as a hardening or furring of the arteries .
it is caused by the formation of multiple plaques within the arteries .
the atheromatous plaque is divided into three distinct components :
the atheroma ( `` lump of gruel , '' from ἀθήρα , athera , gruel in greek ) , which is the nodular accumulation of a soft , flaky , yellowish material at the center of large plaques , composed
underlying areas of cholesterol crystals
calcification at the outer base of older/more advanced lesions .
the following terms are similar , yet distinct , in both spelling and meaning , and can be easily confused : arteriosclerosis , arteriolosclerosis , and atherosclerosis .
arteriosclerosis is a general term describing any hardening ( and loss of elasticity ) of medium or large arteries ( from the greek arteria , meaning artery , and , meaning hardening ) ; arteriolosclerosis is any hardening ( and
the term atherogenic is used for substances or processes that cause atherosclerosis .
atherosclerosis is a chronic disease that remains asymptomatic for decades .
atherosclerotic lesions , or atherosclerotic plaques are separated into two broad categories : stable and unstable ( also called vulnerable ) .
the pathobiology of atherosclerotic lesions is very complicated but generally , stable atherosclerotic plaques , which tend to be asymptomatic , are rich in extracellular matrix and smooth muscle cells , while , unstable plaques are rich in macrophages and
ruptures of the fibrous cap expose thrombogenic material , such as collagen to the circulation and eventually induce thrombus formation in the lumen .
upon formation , intraluminal thrombi can occlude arteries outright ( i.e. coronary occlusion ) , but more often they detach , move into the circulation and eventually occlude smaller downstream branches causing thromboembolism ( i.e. stroke is often caused by
apart from thromboembolism , chronically expanding atherosclerotic lesions can cause complete closure of the lumen .
interestingly , chronically expanding lesions are often asymptomatic until lumen stenosis is so severe that blood supply to downstream tissue ( s ) is insufficient resulting in ischemia .
these complications of advanced atherosclerosis are chronic , slowly progressive and cumulative .
most commonly , soft plaque suddenly ruptures ( see vulnerable plaque ) , causing the formation of a thrombus that will rapidly slow or stop blood flow , leading to death of the tissues fed by the artery in approximately
this catastrophic event is called an infarction .
one of the most common recognized scenarios is called coronary thrombosis of a coronary artery , causing myocardial infarction ( a heart attack ) .
the same process in an artery to the brain is commonly called stroke .
another common scenario in very advanced disease is claudication from insufficient blood supply to the legs , typically caused by a combination of both stenosis and aneurysmal segments narrowed with clots .
atherosclerosis affects the entire artery tree , but mostly larger , high-pressure vessels such as the coronary , renal , femoral , cerebral , and carotid arteries .
these are termed `` clinically silent `` because the person having the infarction does not notice the problem and does not seek medical help , or when they do , physicians do not recognize what has happened .

american cuts of beef including the brisket
brisket is a cut of meat from the breast or lower chest of beef or veal .
the beef brisket is one of the nine beef prime cuts .
the brisket muscles include the superficial and deep pectorals .
as cattle do not have collar bones , these muscles support about 60 % of the body weight of standing/moving cattle .
this requires a significant amount of connective tissue , so the resulting meat must be cooked correctly to tenderize the connective tissue .
according to the random house dictionary of the english language , second edition , the term derives from the middle english brusket which comes from the earlier old norse , meaning cartilage .
the cut overlies the sternum , ribs and connecting costal cartilages .
