owls are a group of birds that belong to the order strigiformes , constituting 200 extant bird of prey species .
most are solitary and nocturnal , with some exceptions ( e.g. , the northern hawk owl ) .
owls hunt mostly small mammals , insects , and other birds , although a few species specialize in hunting fish .
they are found in all regions of the earth except antarctica , most of greenland and some remote islands .
owls are characterized by their small beaks and wide faces , and are divided into two families : the typical owls , strigidae ; and the barn-owls , tytonidae .
the oklahoma city bombing was a domestic terrorist bomb attack on the alfred p. murrah federal building in downtown oklahoma city on april 19 , 1995 .
it would remain the most destructive act of terrorism on american soil until the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
the oklahoma blast claimed 168 lives , including 19 children under the age of 6 , and injured more than 680 people .
the blast destroyed or damaged 324 buildings within a sixteen-block radius , destroyed or burned 86 cars , and shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings .
the bomb was estimated to have caused at least $ 652 million worth of damage .
extensive rescue efforts were undertaken by local , state , federal , and worldwide agencies in the wake of the bombing , and substantial donations were received from across the country .
the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) activated eleven of its urban search and rescue task forces , consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations .
within 90 minutes of the explosion , timothy mcveigh was stopped by oklahoma state trooper charlie hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for unlawfully carrying a weapon .
forensic evidence quickly linked mcveigh and terry nichols to the attack ; nichols was arrested , and within days both were charged .
michael and lori fortier were later identified as accomplices .
mcveigh , an american militia movement sympathizer who was a gulf war veteran , had detonated an explosive-filled ryder rental truck parked in front of the building .
mcveigh 's co-conspirator , terry nichols , had assisted in the bomb preparation .
motivated by his hatred of the federal government and angered by what he perceived as its mishandling of the waco siege ( 1993 ) and the ruby ridge incident ( 1992 ) , mcveigh timed his attack to coincide with
the official investigation , known as `` okbomb '' , was the largest criminal investigation case in american history ; fbi agents conducted 28,000 interviews , amassing of evidence , and collected nearly one billion pieces of information .
the bombers were tried and convicted in 1997 .
mcveigh was executed by lethal injection on june 11 , 2001 , and nichols was sentenced to life in prison .
michael and lori fortier testified against mcveigh and nichols ; michael was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to warn the u.s. government , and lori received immunity from prosecution in exchange for her testimony .
as with other large-scale terrorist attacks , conspiracy theories dispute the official claims and allege the involvement of additional perpetrators .
as a result of the bombing , the u.s. government passed the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 , which tightened the standards for habeas corpus in the united states , as well as legislation designed to increase
on april 19 , 2000 , the oklahoma city national memorial was dedicated on the site of the murrah federal building , commemorating the victims of the bombing .
annual remembrance services are held at the same time of day as the original explosion occurred .

jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun and the largest planet in the solar system .
it is a gas giant with mass one-thousandth that of the sun but is two and a half times the mass of all the other planets in the solar system combined .
jupiter is classified as a gas giant along with saturn , uranus and neptune .
together , these four planets are sometimes referred to as the or outer planets .
the planet was known by astronomers of ancient times , and was associated with the mythology and religious beliefs of many cultures .
the romans named the planet after the roman god jupiter .
when viewed from earth , jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of −2.94 , making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the moon and venus .
( mars can briefly match jupiter 's brightness at certain points in its orbit . )
jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium , although helium only comprises about a tenth of the number of molecules .
it may also have a rocky core of heavier elements , but like the other gas giants , jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface .
because of its rapid rotation , the planet 's shape is that of an oblate spheroid ( it possesses a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator ) .
the outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes , resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries .
a prominent result is the great red spot , a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope .
surrounding jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere .
there are also at least 67 moons , including the four large moons called the galilean moons that were first discovered by galileo galilei in 1610 .
ganymede , the largest of these moons , has a diameter greater than that of the planet mercury .
jupiter has been explored on several occasions by robotic spacecraft , most notably during the early pioneer and voyager flyby missions and later by the galileo orbiter .
the most recent probe to visit jupiter was the pluto -bound new horizons spacecraft in late february 2007 .
the probe used the gravity from jupiter to increase its speed .
future targets for exploration in the jovian system include the possible ice-covered liquid ocean on the moon europa .
the late heavy bombardment ( commonly referred to as the lunar cataclysm , or lhb ) is a hypothetical event around 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago ( ga ) .
during this event a very large number of the impact craters on the moon would have formed , and by inference on earth , mercury , venus and mars as well .
( while the lhb is `` late '' in the solar system 's accretion period when earth and the other rocky planets formed and gained most of their mass , it is early in solar system history . )
the evidence for this event comes primarily from the dating of lunar samples brought back by the apollo astronauts , which indicates that most impact melt rocks formed in this rather narrow interval of time .
while many hypotheses have been put forth to explain a spike in the flux of asteroids or comets in the inner solar system at this time , no consensus yet exists as to its cause .
the nice model , popular among planetary scientists , postulates that the gas giant planets underwent orbital migration and forced objects in the asteroid belt and/or kuiper belt on eccentric orbits that put them in the path of the terrestrial
nevertheless , some researchers argue that the lunar sample data do not require a cataclysmic cratering event near 3.9 ga , and that the apparent clustering of impact melt ages near this time is an artifact of sampling material affected

the federal reserve system ( also known as the federal reserve , and informally as the fed ) is the central banking system of the united states .
it was created on december 23 , 1913 , with the enactment of the federal reserve act , largely in response to a series of financial panics , particularly a severe panic in 1907 .
over time , the roles and responsibilities of the federal reserve system have expanded and its structure has evolved .
events such as the great depression were major factors leading to changes in the system .
the us congress established three key objectives for monetary policy in the federal reserve act : maximum employment , stable prices , and moderate long-term interest rates .
the first two objectives are sometimes referred to as the federal reserve 's dual mandate .
its duties have expanded over the years , and today , according to official federal reserve documentation , include conducting the nation 's monetary policy , supervising and regulating banking institutions , maintaining the stability of the financial system and
the fed also conducts research into the economy and releases numerous publications , such as the beige book .
the federal reserve system 's structure is composed of the presidentially appointed board of governors ( or federal reserve board ) , the federal open market committee ( fomc ) , twelve regional federal reserve banks located in major cities
the fomc is the committee responsible for setting monetary policy and consists of all seven members of the board of governors and the twelve regional bank presidents , though only five bank presidents vote at any given time ( the
the federal reserve system has both private and public components , and was designed to serve the interests of both the general public and private bankers .
the result is a structure that is considered unique among central banks .
it is also unusual in that an entity outside of the central bank , namely the united states department of the treasury , creates the currency used .
according to the board of governors , the federal reserve system `` is considered an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the president or anyone else in the executive or legislative
the authority of the federal reserve system is derived from statutes enacted by the u.s. congress and the system is subject to congressional oversight .
the members of the board of governors , including its chairman and vice-chairman , are chosen by the president and confirmed by the senate .
the government also exercises some control over the federal reserve by appointing and setting the salaries of the system 's highest-level employees .
nationally chartered commercial banks are required to hold stock in the federal reserve bank of their region ; this entitles them to elect some of the members of the board of the regional federal reserve bank .
thus the federal reserve system has both public and private aspects .
the u.s. government receives all of the system 's annual profits , after a statutory dividend of 6 % on member banks ' capital investment is paid , and an account surplus is maintained .
in 2010 , the federal reserve made a profit of $ 82 billion and transferred $ 79 billion to the u.s. treasury .
this was followed at the end of 2011 with a transfer of $ 77 billion in profits to the u.s. treasury department .

an ocean ( ; the world ocean of classical antiquity ) is a body of saline water that composes a large part of a planet 's hydrosphere .
in the context of earth , it refers to one or all of the major divisions of the planet 's world ocean – they are , in descending order of area , the pacific , atlantic , indian , southern
the word `` sea `` is often used interchangeably with `` ocean '' , but strictly speaking a sea is a body of saline water ( possibly a division of the world ocean ) partly or fully enclosed by land
earth is the only planet known to have an ocean ( or any large amounts of open liquid water ) .
approximately 72 % of the planet 's surface ( ~3.6x108 km2 ) is covered by saline water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas , with the ocean covering approximately 71 % of the earth 's
in terms of the hydrosphere of the earth , the ocean contains 97 % of the earth 's water .
oceanographers have stated that out of 97 % , only 5 % of the ocean as a whole on earth has been explored .
because it is the principal component of earth 's hydrosphere , the world ocean is integral to all known life , forms part of the carbon cycle , and influences climate and weather patterns .
the total volume is approximately 1.3 billion cubic kilometres ( 310 million cu mi ) with an average depth of .
it is the habitat of 230,000 known species , although much of the ocean 's depths remain unexplored and it is estimated that over two million marine species exist .
the origin of earth 's oceans is still unknown , but oceans are believed to have formed in the hadean period and may have been the impetus for the emergence of life .
extraterrestrial oceans may be composed of a wide range of elements and compounds .
the only confirmed large stable bodies of extraterrestrial surface liquids are the lakes of titan , although there is evidence for the existence of oceans elsewhere in the solar system .
early in their geologic histories , mars and venus are theorized to have had large water oceans .
the mars ocean hypothesis suggests that nearly a third of the surface of mars was once covered by water , though the water on mars is no longer oceanic , and a runaway greenhouse effect may have boiled away the
compounds such as salts and ammonia dissolved in water lower its freezing point , so that water might exist in large quantities in extraterrestrial environments as brine or convecting ice .
unconfirmed oceans are speculated beneath the surface of many dwarf planets and natural satellites ; notably , the ocean of europa is believed to have over twice the water volume of earth .
the solar system 's gas giant planets are also believed to possess liquid atmospheric layers of yet to be confirmed compositions .
oceans may also exist on exoplanets and exomoons , including surface oceans of liquid water within a circumstellar habitable zone .
ocean planets are a hypothetical type of planet with a surface completely covered with liquid .
the plus-minus sign ( ) is a mathematical symbol commonly used either
to indicate the precision of an approximation , or
to indicate a value that can be of either sign .
the sign is normally pronounced `` plus or minus '' .
in experimental sciences , the sign commonly indicates the confidence interval or error in a measurement , often the standard deviation or standard error .
the sign may also represent an inclusive range of values that a reading might have .
in mathematics , it may indicate two possible values : one positive , and one negative .
it is commonly used in indicating a range of values , such as in mathematical statements .
judgment as a matter of law ( jmol ) is a motion made by a party , during trial , claiming the opposing party has insufficient evidence to reasonably support its case .
jmol is also known as a directed verdict , which it has replaced in american federal courts .
jmol is similar to judgment on the pleadings and summary judgment , all of which test the factual sufficiency of a claim .
judgment on the pleadings is a motion made after pleading and before discovery ; summary judgment happens after discovery and before trial ; jmol occurs during trial .
in united states federal courts , jmol is a creation of federal rules of civil procedure rule 50 .
jmol is decided by the standard of whether a reasonable jury could find in favor of the party opposing the jmol motion .
if there is no evidence to support a reasonable conclusion for the opposing party , judgment is entered by the court and the case is over .
if there is sufficient evidence to make a reasonable conclusion in favor of the opposing party , but there is equally strong evidence to support an opposite conclusion , the party with the burden of persuasion fails .
timing is very important in making a motion for jmol ; the motion can only be made once the opposing party has presented its case .
in civil cases , the plaintiff presents her case , then the defendant presents his/her case , then the plaintiff may present a rebuttal .
so , once the plaintiff has presented his/her case , the defendant may move for jmol , but the plaintiff may not .
once the defendant has finished presenting his/her case , the plaintiff may move for jmol , and so may the defendant .
jmol motions may also be made after the verdict is returned , where they are called `` renewed '' motions for judgment as a matter of law ( rjmol ) , but the motion is still commonly known by its
however , in order to move for j.n.o.v. , the movant must have moved for a jmol before the verdict as well .
this procedural quirk is necessary because it is considered a violation of the 7th amendment for a judge to overturn a jury verdict .
instead , the judge is said in a j.n.o.v. to be reexamining not the verdict , but his previous rejection of jmol .

a season is a subdivision of the year , marked by changes in weather , ecology , and hours of daylight .
seasons result from the yearly revolution of the earth around the sun and the tilt of the earth 's axis relative to the plane of revolution .
in temperate and polar regions , the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the earth 's surface , variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate , and plants
during may , june and july , the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun .
the same is true of the southern hemisphere in november , december and january .
it is the tilt of the earth that causes the sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux .
however , due to seasonal lag , june , july and august are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and december , january and february are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere .
in temperate and subpolar regions , generally four calendar -based seasons ( with their adjectives ) are recognized : spring ( vernal ) , summer ( estival ) , autumn ( autumnal ) and winter ( hibernal ) .
however , ecologists mostly use a six season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring ( prevernal ) and late summer ( serotinal ) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four .
hot regions have two or three seasons ; the rainy ( or wet , or monsoon ) season and the dry season , and in some tropical areas , a cool or mild season .
in some parts of the world , special `` seasons '' are loosely defined based on important events such as a hurricane season , tornado season or a wildfire season .

stonehenge , an example of neolithic architecture post and lintel construction .
post and lintel , `` prop and lintel '' or `` trabeated '' is a simple construction method using a lintel , header , or architrave as the horizontal member over a building void supported at its ends by two
this architectural system and building method has been commonly used for centuries to support the weight of the structure located above the openings created by windows and doors in a bearing wall .
post and lintel is different than a beam joined between two posts , it must pass over the tops of the supports .
post-and-beam is a general term for any kind of timber framing .
the thyroid hormones , triiodothyronine ( t3 ) and thyroxine ( t4 ) , are tyrosine -based hormones produced by the thyroid gland that are primarily responsible for regulation of metabolism .
iodine is necessary for the production of t3 and t4 .
a deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of t3 and t4 , enlarges the thyroid tissue and will cause the disease known as goitre .
the major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine ( t4 ) , which has a longer half-life than t3 .
the ratio of t4 to t3 released into the blood is roughly 20 to 1 .
t4 is converted to the active t3 ( three to four times more potent than t4 ) within cells by deiodinases ( 5'-iodinase ) .
these are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine ( t1a ) and thyronamine ( t0a ) .
all three isoforms of the deiodinases are selenium-containing enzymes , thus dietary selenium is essential for t3 production .
james byron dean ( february 8 , 1931 – september 30 , 1955 ) was an american actor .
he is a cultural icon of teenage disillusionment , as expressed in the title of his most celebrated film , rebel without a cause ( 1955 ) , in which he starred as troubled los angeles teenager jim stark .
the other two roles that defined his stardom were as loner cal trask in east of eden ( 1955 ) , and as the surly ranch hand , jett rink , in giant ( 1956 ) .
dean 's enduring fame and popularity rests on his performances in only these three films , all leading roles .
his premature death in a car crash cemented his legendary status .
dean was the first actor to receive a posthumous academy award nomination for best actor and remains the only actor to have had two posthumous acting nominations .
in 1999 , the american film institute ranked dean the 18th best male movie star on their afi 's 100 years ... 100 stars list .
diaphragm pump schematic .
a diaphragm pump ( also known as a membrane pump , air operated double diaphragm pump ( aodd ) or pneumatic diaphragm pump ) is a positive displacement pump that uses a combination of the reciprocating action of a rubber
there are three main types of diaphragm pumps :
those in which the diaphragm is sealed with one side in the fluid to be pumped , and the other in air or hydraulic fluid .
the diaphragm is flexed , causing the volume of the pump chamber to increase and decrease .
a pair of non-return check valves prevent reverse flow of the fluid .
those employing volumetric positive displacement where the prime mover of the diaphragm is electro-mechanical , working through a crank or geared motor drive , or purely mechanical , such as with a lever or handle .
this method flexes the diaphragm through simple mechanical action , and one side of the diaphragm is open to air .
those employing one or more unsealed diaphragms with the fluid to be pumped on both sides .
the diaphragm ( s ) again are flexed , causing the volume to change .
when the volume of a chamber of either type of pump is increased ( the diaphragm moving up ) , the pressure decreases , and fluid is drawn into the chamber .
when the chamber pressure later increases from decreased volume ( the diaphragm moving down ) , the fluid previously drawn in is forced out .
finally , the diaphragm moving up once again draws fluid into the chamber , completing the cycle .
this action is similar to that of the cylinder in an internal combustion engine .

the company was founded by bill gates and paul allen on april 4 , 1975 .
microsoft is the world 's largest software maker measured by revenues .
it is also one of the world 's most valuable companies .
microsoft was established to develop and sell basic interpreters for the altair 8800 .
it rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with ms-dos in the mid-1980s , followed by the microsoft windows line of operating systems .
the company 's 1986 initial public offering , and subsequent rise in its share price , created an estimated three billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from microsoft employees .
since the 1990s , it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions .
in may 2011 , microsoft acquired skype technologies for $ 8.5 billion in its largest acquisition to date .
as of 2013 , microsoft is market dominant in both the pc operating system and office suite markets ( the latter with microsoft office ) .
the company also produces a wide range of other software for desktops and servers , and is active in areas including internet search ( with bing ) , the video game industry ( with the xbox and xbox 360 consoles
in june 2012 , microsoft announced that it would be entering the pc vendor market for the first time , with the launch of the microsoft surface tablet computer .
in the 1990s , critics began to contend that microsoft used monopolistic business practices and anti-competitive strategies including refusal to deal and tying , put unreasonable restrictions in the use of its software , and used misrepresentative marketing tactics ;

new berlin observatory at linden street , where neptune was discovered observationally .
the planet neptune was mathematically predicted before it was directly observed .
with a prediction by urbain le verrier , telescopic observations confirming the existence of a major planet were made on the night of september 23–24 , 1846 , at the berlin observatory , by astronomer johann gottfried galle ( assisted
it was a sensational moment of 19th century science and dramatic confirmation of newtonian gravitational theory .
in françois arago 's apt phrase , le verrier had discovered a planet `` with the point of his pen '' .
in retrospect , after it was discovered it turned out it had been observed many times before but not recognized , and there were others who made various calculations about its location , which did not lead to its observation
by 1846 the planet uranus had completed nearly one full orbit since its discovery by william herschel in 1781 , and astronomers had detected a series of irregularities in its path which could not be entirely explained by newton 's
these irregularities could , however , be resolved if the gravity of a farther , unknown planet were disturbing its path around the sun .
in 1845 astronomers urbain le verrier in paris and john couch adams in cambridge separately began calculations to determine the nature and position of such a planet .
unfortunately , le verrier 's triumph also led to a tense international dispute over priority , as , shortly after the discovery , george airy , at the time british astronomer royal , announced that adams had also predicted the
nevertheless , the royal society awarded le verrier the copley medal in 1846 for his achievement , without mention of adams .

berliners watching a c-54 land at tempelhof airport ( 1948 )
the berlin blockade ( 24 june 1948 – 12 may 1949 ) was one of the first major international crises of the cold war .
during the multinational occupation of post–world war ii germany , the soviet union blocked the western allies ' railway , road , and canal access to the sectors of berlin under allied control .
their aim was to force the western powers to allow the soviet zone to start supplying berlin with food and fuel , thereby giving the soviets practical control over the entire city .
in response , the western allies organized the berlin airlift to carry supplies to the people in west berlin .
aircrews from the united states air force , the british royal air force , the royal australian air force , the royal canadian air force , the royal new zealand air force , and the south african air force flew
by the spring of 1949 , the effort was clearly succeeding and , by april , the airlift was delivering more cargo than had previously been transported into the city by rail .
the success of the berlin airlift brought embarrassment to the soviets who had refused to believe it could make a difference .
the blockade was lifted in may 1949 and resulted in the creation of two separate german states .
the federal republic of germany ( west germany ) and the german democratic republic ( east germany ) split up berlin .
in remembrance of the airlift , three airports in the former western zones of the city served as the primary gateways to germany for another fifty years .
`` proud mary '' is a rock song written by american singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist john fogerty , and recorded by his band creedence clearwater revival .
the song was released as a single from the band 's second studio album , bayou country , both released by fantasy records in january 1969 ( although another reference related to album liner notes says just before christmas ,
the song became a hit in the united states , peaking at # 2 on the billboard hot 100 in march 1969 , the first of five non-consecutive singles to peak at # 2 for the group .
in physiology , body water is the water content of the human body .
a significant fraction of the human body is water .
arthur guyton 's textbook of medical physiology states that `` the total amount of water in a man of average weight ( 70 kilograms ) is approximately 40 litres , averaging 57 percent of his total body weight .
in a newborn infant , this may be as high as 75 percent of the body weight , but it progressively decreases from birth to old age , most of the decrease occurring during the first 10 years of life
also , obesity decreases the percentage of water in the body , sometimes to as low as 45 percent '' .
these figures are statistical averages , so are illustrative , and like all biostatistics , will vary with things like type of population , age and number of people sampled , and methodology .
so there is not , and can not be , a figure that is exactly the same for all people , for this or any other physiological measure .
for example , jackson 's ( 1985 ) anatomy & physiology for nurses gives a figure of 60 % for the proportion of body-weight attributable to water , which approximates guyton 's 57 % .
in diseased states where body water is affected , the compartment or compartments that have changed can give clues to the nature of the problem .
body water is regulated by hormones , including anti-diuretic hormone ( adh ) , aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide .
per netter 's atlas of human physiology , body water is broken down into the following compartments :
intracellular fluid ( 2/3 of body water ) .
per guyton , in a body containing 40 litres of fluid , about 25 litres is intracellular , which amounts to 62.5 % ( 5/8 ) , close enough to the 2/3 rule of thumb .
jackson 's texts states 70 % of body fluid is intracellular .
extracellular fluid ( 1/3 of body water ) .
per guyton 's illustration , for a 40 litre body , about 15 litres is extracellular , which amounts to 37.5 % again , this is close to the 1/3 rule of thumb cited here .
plasma ( 1/5 of extracellular fluid ) .
per guyton 's illustration , of the 15 litres of extracellular fluid , plasma volume averages 3 litres .
this amounts to 20 % , the same as per netter 's atlas .
interstitial fluid ( 4/5 of extracellular fluid )
transcellular fluid ( a.k.a. `` third space , '' normally ignored in calculations )
contained inside organs , such as the gastrointestinal , cerebrospinal , peritoneal , and ocular fluids .
personifications of germany , france , russia , austria-hungary , and the united kingdom attempting to keep the lid on the simmering cauldron of imperialist and nationalist tensions in the balkans to prevent a general european war .
they were successful in 1912 and 1913 but did not succeed in in 1914 .
the causes of world war i , which began in central europe in late july 1914 and finished in 1918 , included many factors , such as the conflicts and hostility of the four decades leading up to the war
militarism , alliances , imperialism , and nationalism played major roles in the conflict as well .
the immediate origins of the war , however , lay in the decisions taken by statesmen and generals during the crisis of 1914 , casus belli for which was the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand ( the archduke of austria
the crisis came after a long and difficult series of diplomatic clashes between the great powers ( italy , france , germany , the british empire , the austria-hungarian empire and russia ) over european and colonial issues in the
in turn these diplomatic clashes can be traced to changes in the balance of power in europe since 1867 .
the more immediate cause for the war was tensions over territory in the balkans .
austria-hungary competed with serbia and russia for territory and influence in the region and they pulled the rest of the great powers into the conflict through their various alliances and treaties .
although the chain of events unleashed by the assassination triggered the war , the war 's origins go deeper , involving national politics , cultures , economics , and a complex web of alliances and counterbalances that had developed between
some of the most important long term or structural causes are : the growth of nationalism across europe , unresolved territorial disputes , an intricate system of alliances , the perceived breakdown of the balance of power in europe ,
other causes that came into play during the diplomatic crisis that preceded the war included misperceptions of intent ( e.g. , the german belief that the united kingdom would remain neutral ) and delays and misunderstandings in diplomatic communications .
the various categories of explanation for world war i correspond to different historians ' overall methods .
most historians and popular commentators include causes from more than one category of explanation to provide a rounded account of the causes of the war .
the deepest distinction among these accounts is between stories that see it as the inevitable and predictable outcome of certain factors , and those that describe it as an arbitrary and unfortunate mistake .
in attributing causes for the war , historians and academics had to deal with an unprecedented flood of memoirs and official documents , released as each country involved tried to avoid blame for starting the war .
early releases of information by governments , particularly those released for use by the `` commission on the responsibility of the authors of the war '' were shown to be incomplete and biased .
in addition some documents , especially diplomatic cables between russia and france , were found to have been doctored .
even in later decades however , when much more information had been released , historians from the same culture have been shown to come to differing conclusions on the causes of the war .
subtractive color mixing
an 1877 color photo by louis ducos du hauron , a french pioneer of color photography .
the overlapping subtractive yellow , cyan and red ( magenta ) image elements can clearly be seen .
a subtractive color model explains the mixing of a limited set of dyes , inks , paint pigments or natural colorants to create a wider range of colors , each the result of partially or completely subtracting ( that is
the color that a surface displays depends on which parts of the visible spectrum are not absorbed and therefore remain visible .
subtractive color systems start with light , presumably white light .
colored inks , paints , or filters between the viewer and the light source or reflective surface subtract wavelengths from the light , giving it color .
if the incident light is other than white , our visual mechanisms are able to compensate well , but not perfectly , often giving a flawed impression of the `` true '' color of the surface .
conversely , additive color systems start with darkness .
light sources of various wavelengths are added in various proportions to produce a range of colors .
the component lights may be inherently colored or simply white light that has passed through suitable subtractive color filters ; their combination is an additive one in either case .
usually , three primary colors are combined to stimulate humans’ trichromatic color vision , sensed by the three types of cone cells in the eye , giving an apparently full range .

a screenshot of the gnome shell gui .
the xerox alto was the first to use a graphical user interface .
in computing , graphical user interface ( gui , sometimes pronounced 'gooey ' ) is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices using images rather than text commands .
guis can be used in computers , hand-held devices such as mp3 players , portable media players or gaming devices , household appliances , office , and industry equipment .
a gui represents the information and actions available to a user through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation , as opposed to text-based interfaces , typed command labels or text navigation .
the actions are usually performed through direct manipulation of the graphical elements .
the term gui is restricted to the scope of two-dimensional display screens with display resolutions able to describe generic information , in the tradition of the computer science research at the parc ( palo alto research center ) .
the term gui is not usually applied to other low-resolution types of interfaces that are non-generic , such as video games ( where hud is preferred ) , or not restricted to flat screens , like volumetric displays .
adapter between a female bnc connector and banana plugs
audiophile banana plugs connected to a loudspeaker
a banana connector ( commonly banana plug for the male , banana socket or banana jack for the female ) is a single- wire ( one conductor ) electrical connector used for joining wires to equipment .
the term 4 mm connector is also used , especially in europe , although not all banana connectors will mate with 4 mm parts .
the plugs are frequently used to terminate patch cords for electronic test equipment .
they are also often used as the plugs on the cables connecting the amplifier to the loudspeakers in hi-fi sound systems .
the plug was invented in 1924 by richard hirschmann ( former richard hirschmann gmbh & co. ) .
in greek mythology , the trojan war was waged against the city of troy by the achaeans ( greeks ) after paris of troy took helen from her husband menelaus king of sparta .
the war is one of the most important events in greek mythology and has been narrated through many works of greek literature , most notably through homer 's iliad and the odyssey .
the iliad relates a part of the last year of the siege of troy ; the odyssey describes odysseus 's journey home .
other parts of the war are contained in a cycle of epic poems , which have survived through fragments .
episodes from the war provided material for greek tragedy and other works of greek literature , and for roman poets including virgil and ovid .
the war originated from a quarrel between the goddesses athena , hera , and aphrodite , after eris , the goddess of strife and discord , gave them a golden apple , sometimes known as the apple of discord ,
zeus sent the goddesses to paris , who judged that aphrodite , as the `` fairest '' , should receive the apple .
in exchange , aphrodite made helen , the most beautiful of all women and wife of menelaus , fall in love with paris , who took her to troy .
agamemnon , king of mycenae and the brother of helen 's husband menelaus , led an expedition of achaean troops to troy and besieged the city for ten years because of paris ' insult .
after the deaths of many heroes , including the achaeans achilles and ajax , and the trojans hector and paris , the city fell to the ruse of the trojan horse .
the achaeans slaughtered the trojans ( except for some of the women and children whom they kept or sold as slaves ) and desecrated the temples , thus earning the gods ' wrath .
few of the achaeans returned safely to their homes and many founded colonies in distant shores .
the romans later traced their origin to aeneas , one of the trojans , who was said to have led the surviving trojans to modern-day italy .
the ancient greeks thought that the trojan war was a historical event that had taken place in the 13th or 12th century bc , and believed that troy was located in modern-day turkey near the dardanelles .
by modern times , both the war and the city were widely believed to be non-historical .
in 1868 , however , the german archaeologist heinrich schliemann met frank calvert , who convinced schliemann that troy was at hissarlik and schliemann took over calvert 's excavations on property belonging to calvert ; this claim is now accepted
whether there is any historical reality behind the trojan war is an open question .
many scholars believe that there is a historical core to the tale , though this may simply mean that the homeric stories are a fusion of various tales of sieges and expeditions by mycenaean greeks during the bronze age .
those who believe that the stories of the trojan war are derived from a specific historical conflict usually date it to the 12th or 11th centuries bc , often preferring the dates given by eratosthenes , 1194–1184 bc , which
the free soil party was a short-lived political party in the united states active in the 1848 and 1852 presidential elections , and in some state elections .
founded in buffalo , new york , it was a third party and a single-issue party that largely appealed to and drew its greatest strength from new york state .
the party leadership consisted of former anti-slavery members of the whig party and the democratic party .
its main purpose was opposing the expansion of slavery into the western territories , arguing that free men on free soil comprised a morally and economically superior system to slavery .
they opposed slavery in the new territories ( agreeing with the wilmot proviso ) and sometimes worked to remove existing laws that discriminated against freed african americans in states such as ohio .
the party membership was largely absorbed by the republican party in 1854 .

mercury has a very tenuous and highly variable atmosphere ( surface-bound exosphere ) containing hydrogen , helium , oxygen , sodium , calcium , potassium and water vapor , with a combined pressure level of about 10−14 bar ( 1
the exospheric species originate either from the solar wind or from the planetary crust .
solar light pushes the atmospheric gases away from the sun , creating a comet-like tail behind the planet .
the existence of a atmosphere had been contentious before 1974 , although by that time a consensus had formed that mercury , like the moon , lacked any substantial atmosphere .
this conclusion was confirmed in 1974 when the mariner 10 spacecraft discovered only a tenuous exosphere .
later , in 2008 , improved measurements were obtained by the messenger spacecraft , which discovered magnesium in the hermian exosphere .

the chevrolet monte carlo was an american-made two-door coupe introduced for model year 1970 , and manufactured over six generations through model year 2007 .
it was marketed as a personal-luxury coupe through most of its history , with the last model version being classified as a full-sized coupe .
when it was discontinued in 2007 , it had outlived many competitors that were either discontinued many years earlier or changed in concept to either a four-door sedan or small sport coupe .
the monte carlo endured six design generations .
the first four ( 1970–72 , 1973–77 , 1978–80 and 1981–88 ) were of a rear-wheel-drive , v8-powered ( v6 available beginning in 1978 ) coupe style , utilizing separate body-on-frame construction .
the later rear-wheel-drive generations bucked the trend of unit-body construction , along with smaller engines , that became more prevalent in the early 1980s as automakers downsized their vehicle lines to meet increasing stringent fuel-economy regulations in the aftermath of
despite those trends , the monte carlo remained a popular seller and even regained the ss version ( initially offered for 1970-71 with 454 cubic-inch v8 ) from mid-1983 to 1988 with a high-performance 305-cubic-inch v8 .
following a several year hiatus following the discontinuation of the rear-drive monte carlo after 1988 , the nameplate was revived for 1995 on a front-drive , v6-powered coupe based on the chevrolet lumina sedan .
it was succeeded by the sixth and final-generation monte carlo in 2000 that was built alongside the chevrolet impala , which succeeded the lumina as chevy 's mid-sized sedan .
the monte carlo ss was revived from 2000 to 2007 and initially powered by 3.8-liter v6 ( supercharged in 2004–2005 ) , later to be replaced by a 5.3-liter v8 for 2006–2007 .

the four major leagues in the united states are the national basketball association ( nba ) , national football league ( nfl ) , major league baseball ( mlb ) , the national hockey league ( nhl ) ; all
three of those leagues have teams that represent canadian cities , and all four are among the most lucrative sports leagues in the world .
soccer ( association football ) is less popular as a spectator sport in the united states than it is in many other countries , though it has wide participation in amateur and semi-professional levels .
the top league , major league soccer , continues to grow and has surpassed the nba and the nhl in average attendance , although it lags far behind in revenue and tv viewership .
professional teams in all major sports operate as franchises within a league .
all major sports leagues use the same type of schedule with a playoff tournament after the regular season ends .
in addition to the major league-level organizations , several sports also have professional minor leagues .
sports are particularly associated with education in the united states , with most high schools and universities having organized sports .
college sports competitions play an important role in the american sporting culture .
in many cases college athletics are more popular than professional sports , with the major sanctioning body being the ncaa .
a newton metre is a unit of torque ( also called `` moment `` ) in the si system .
the symbolic form is n m or n·m , .
one newton metre , sometimes hyphenated newton-metre , is equal to the torque resulting from a force of one newton applied perpendicularly to a moment arm which is one metre long .
it is also used less commonly as a unit of work , or energy , in which case it is equivalent to the more common and standard si unit of energy , the joule .
in this very different usage the metre term represents the distance traveled or displacement in the direction of the force , and not the perpendicular distance from a fulcrum as it does when used to express torque .
this usage is discouraged by the si authority , since it can lead to confusion as to whether a given quantity expressed in newton-meters is a torque or a quantity of energy .
john adams ( october 30 , 1735 ( o.s. october 19 , 1735 ) – july 4 , 1826 ) was the second president of the united states ( 1797–1801 ) , having earlier served as the first vice president
an american founding father , he was a statesman , diplomat , and a leading advocate of american independence from great britain .
well educated , he was an enlightenment political theorist who promoted republicanism and wrote prolifically about his often seminal ideas , both in published works and in letters to his wife and key adviser abigail as well as to other
adams came to prominence in the early stages of the american revolution .
a lawyer and public figure in boston , as a delegate from massachusetts to the continental congress , he played a leading role in persuading congress to declare independence .
he assisted thomas jefferson in drafting the declaration of independence in 1776 , and was its primary advocate in the congress .
later , as a diplomat in europe , he helped negotiate the eventual peace treaty with great britain , and was responsible for obtaining vital governmental loans from amsterdam bankers .
a political theorist and historian , adams largely wrote the massachusetts constitution in 1780 , which together with his earlier thoughts on government , influenced american political thought .
one of his greatest roles was as a judge of character : in 1775 , he nominated george washington to be commander-in-chief , and 25 years later nominated john marshall to be chief justice of the united states .
adams ' revolutionary credentials secured him two terms as george washington 's vice president and his own election in 1796 as the second president .
during his one term , he encountered ferocious attacks by the jeffersonian republicans , as well as the dominant faction in his own federalist party led by his bitter enemy alexander hamilton .
adams signed the controversial alien and sedition acts , and built up the army and navy especially in the face of an undeclared naval war ( called the `` quasi-war `` ) with france , 1798–1800 .
the major accomplishment of his presidency was his peaceful resolution of the conflict in the face of hamilton 's opposition .
in 1800 , adams was defeated for re-election by thomas jefferson and retired to massachusetts .
he later resumed his friendship with jefferson .
he and his wife , abigail adams , founded an accomplished family line of politicians , diplomats , and historians now referred to as the adams political family .
adams was the father of john quincy adams , the sixth president of the united states .
his achievements have received greater recognition in modern times , though his contributions were not initially as celebrated as those of other founders .
adams was the first u.s. president to reside in the building that eventually became known as the white house .
am-2201 ( 1- ( 5-fluoropentyl ) -3- ( 1-naphthoyl ) indole ) is a research chemical that acts as a potent but nonselective full agonist for the cannabinoid receptor .
it is part of the am series of cannabinoids discovered by alexandros makriyannis at northeastern university .
reputed recreational use of am-2201 in the united states has led to it being specifically listed in a proposed 2011 amendment to the controlled substances act , aiming to add a number of synthetic drugs into schedule i .
there have been anecdotal reports of individuals experiencing panic attacks and vomiting , at doses as small as 2 milligrams .
as the dosage is much smaller than most other synthetic cannabinoids , users may accidentally dose too much .
convulsions have been reported at doses exceeding 10 milligrams .
caution should be taken if using this substance as it is active at doses as small as 500 μg ( micrograms ) , has a very steep dose-response curve , and tolerance builds up very quickly to the effects .
as of november 2011 , there have been no reports of death associated with the drug .
the toxicity of am-2201 is still a matter of debate and there may be long term side effects .
george washington ( – , 1799 ) was the first president of the united states ( 1789–1797 ) , the commander-in-chief of the continental army during the american revolutionary war , and one of the founding fathers of the united
he presided over the convention that drafted the constitution , which replaced the articles of confederation and established the position of president .
washington was elected president as the unanimous choice of the 69 electors in 1788 , and he served two terms in office .
he oversaw the creation of a strong , well-financed national government that maintained neutrality in the wars raging in europe , suppressed rebellion , and won acceptance among americans of all types .
his leadership style established many forms and rituals of government that have been used since , such as using a cabinet system and delivering an inaugural address .
further , the peaceful transition from his presidency to the presidency of john adams established a tradition that continues into the 21st century .
washington was hailed as `` father of his country `` even during his lifetime .
washington was born into the provincial gentry of colonial virginia ; his wealthy planter family owned tobacco plantations and slaves .
after both his father and older brother died when he was young , washington became personally and professionally attached to the powerful william fairfax , who promoted his career as a surveyor and soldier .
washington quickly became a senior officer in the colonial forces during the first stages of the french and indian war .
chosen by the second continental congress in 1775 to be commander-in-chief of the continental army in the american revolution , washington managed to force the british out of boston in 1776 , but was defeated and almost captured later that
after crossing the delaware river in the dead of winter , he defeated the british in two battles , retook new jersey and restored momentum to the patriot cause .
because of his strategy , revolutionary forces captured two major british armies at saratoga in 1777 and yorktown in 1781 .
historians laud washington for his selection and supervision of his generals , encouragement of morale and ability to hold together the army , coordination with the state governors and state militia units , relations with congress and attention to supplies
in battle , however , washington was repeatedly outmaneuvered by british generals with larger armies .
after victory had been finalized in 1783 , washington resigned as commander-in-chief rather than seize power , proving his opposition to dictatorship and his commitment to american republicanism .
dissatisfied with the weaknesses of the articles of confederation , in 1787 washington presided over the constitutional convention that drafted the united states constitution .
elected unanimously as the first president of the united states in 1789 , he attempted to bring rival factions together to unify the nation .
he supported alexander hamilton 's programs to pay off all state and national debt , to implement an effective tax system and to create a national bank ( despite opposition from thomas jefferson ) .
washington proclaimed the united states neutral in the wars raging in europe after 1793 .
he avoided war with great britain and guaranteed a decade of peace and profitable trade by securing the jay treaty in 1795 , despite intense opposition from the jeffersonians .
although never officially joining the federalist party , he supported its programs .
washington 's farewell address was an influential primer on republican virtue and a warning against partisanship , sectionalism , and involvement in foreign wars .
he retired from the presidency in 1797 and returned to his home , mount vernon , and his domestic life where he managed a variety of enterprises .
he freed all his slaves by his final will .
washington had a vision of a great and powerful nation that would be built on republican lines using federal power .
he sought to use the national government to preserve liberty , improve infrastructure , open the western lands , promote commerce , found a permanent capital , reduce regional tensions and promote a spirit of american nationalism .
at his death , washington was eulogized as `` first in war , first in peace , and first in the hearts of his countrymen '' by henry lee .
the federalists made him the symbol of their party but for many years , the jeffersonians continued to distrust his influence and delayed building the washington monument .
as the leader of the first successful revolution against a colonial empire in world history , washington became an international icon for liberation and nationalism , especially in france and latin america .

justinian i ( ) ( , ) ( c. 482 – 14 november 565 ) , commonly known as justinian the great , was byzantine emperor from 527 to 565 .
during his reign , justinian sought to revive the empire 's greatness and reconquer the lost western half of the classical roman empire .
one of the most important figures of late antiquity and the last roman emperor to speak latin as a first language , justinian 's rule constitutes a distinct epoch in the history of the eastern roman empire .
the impact of his administration extended far beyond the boundaries of his time and domain .
justinian 's reign is marked by the ambitious but only partly realized renovatio imperii , or `` restoration of the empire '' .
because of his restoration activities , justinian has sometimes been called the `` last roman `` in modern historiography .
this ambition was expressed by the partial recovery of the territories of the defunct western roman empire .
his general belisarius swiftly conquered the vandal kingdom in north africa , extending roman control to the atlantic ocean .
subsequently belisarius , narses , and other generals conquered the ostrogothic kingdom , restoring dalmatia , sicily , italy , and rome to the empire after more than half a century of barbarian control .
the prefect liberius reclaimed most of southern iberia , establishing the province of spania .
these campaigns re-established roman control over the western mediterranean , increasing the empire 's annual revenue by over a million solidi .
during his reign justinian also subdued the tzani , a people on the east coast of the black sea that had never been under roman rule before .
a still more resonant aspect of his legacy was the uniform rewriting of roman law , the corpus juris civilis , which is still the basis of civil law in many modern states .
this work was carried out primarily by his quaestor tribonian .
his reign also marked a blossoming of byzantine culture , and his building program yielded such masterpieces as the church of hagia sophia , which was to be the center of eastern orthodox christianity for many centuries .
a devastating outbreak of bubonic plague ( see plague of justinian ) in the early 540s marked the end of an age of splendour .
the empire entered a period of territorial decline not to be reversed until the 9th century .
procopius provides the primary source for the history of justinian 's reign .
the syriac chronicle of john of ephesus , which does not survive , was used as a source for later chronicles , contributing many additional details of value .
both historians became very bitter towards justinian and his empress , theodora .
other sources include the histories of agathias , menander protector , john malalas , the paschal chronicle , the chronicles of marcellinus comes and victor of tunnuna .
justinian is considered a saint amongst orthodox christians , and is also remembered by some in the lutheran church on november 14 .
the appalachian national scenic trail , generally known as the appalachian trail or simply the a.t. , is a marked hiking trail in the eastern united states extending between springer mountain in georgia and mount katahdin in maine .

the total length is approximately .
the trail passes through the states of georgia , north carolina , tennessee , virginia , west virginia , maryland , pennsylvania , new jersey , new york , connecticut , massachusetts , vermont , new hampshire , and maine
the path is maintained by 30 trail clubs and multiple partnerships , and managed by the national park service and the nonprofit appalachian trail conservancy .
the majority of the trail is in wilderness , although some portions traverse towns , roads and cross rivers .
the appalachian trail is famous for its many hikers , some of whom , called thru-hikers , attempt to hike it in its entirety in a single season .
many books , memoirs , web sites and fan organizations are dedicated to this pursuit .
an unofficial extension known as the international appalachian trail continues north into canada and to the end of the range , where it enters the atlantic ocean .
the appalachian trail , the continental divide trail , and the pacific crest trail form what is known as the triple crown of long distance hiking in the united states .

context-dependent memory refers to improved recall of specific episodes or information when the context present at encoding and retrieval are the same .
one particularly common example of context-dependence at work occurs when an individual has lost an item ( e.g. lost car keys ) in an unknown location .
typically , people try to systematically `` retrace their steps '' to determine all of the possible places where the item might be located .
based on the role that context plays in determining recall , it is not at all surprising that individuals often quite easily discover the lost item upon returning to the correct context .
this example best describes the concept of context-dependent forgetting .
however , the research literature on context-dependent memory describes a number of different types of contextual information that may affect recall such as environmental context-dependent memory , state-dependent learning , cognitive context-dependent memory and mood-congruent memory .
research has also shown that context-dependence may play an important role in numerous situations , such as memory for studied material , or events that have occurred following the consumption of alcohol or drugs .

caylee marie anthony ( august 9 , 2005 – 2008 ) was a two-year-old american girl who lived in orlando , florida with her mother , casey marie anthony , and her maternal grandparents , george and cindy anthony .
on july 15 , 2008 , she was reported missing to by cindy , who said she had not seen caylee for 31 days and that casey 's car smelled like a dead body had been inside it .

the parthenon ( ) is a temple on the athenian acropolis , greece , dedicated to the maiden goddess athena , whom the people of athens considered their patron deity .
its construction began in 447 bc when the athenian empire was at the height of its power .
it was completed in 438 bc , although decoration of the building continued until 432 bc .
it is the most important surviving building of classical greece , generally considered the culmination of the development of the doric order .
its decorative sculptures are considered some of the high points of greek art .
the parthenon is regarded as an enduring symbol of ancient greece , athenian democracy , western civilization and one of the world 's greatest cultural monuments .
the greek ministry of culture is currently carrying out a program of selective restoration and reconstruction to ensure the stability of the partially ruined structure .
the parthenon itself replaced an older temple of athena , which historians call the pre-parthenon or older parthenon , that was destroyed in the persian invasion of 480 bc .
the temple is archaeoastronomically aligned to the hyades .
like most greek temples , the parthenon was used as a treasury .
for a time , it also served as the treasury of the delian league , which later became the athenian empire .
in the 5th century ad , the parthenon was converted into a christian church dedicated to the virgin mary .
after the ottoman conquest , it was turned into a mosque in the early 1460s .
on 26 september 1687 , an ottoman ammunition dump inside the building was ignited by venetian bombardment .
the resulting explosion severely damaged the parthenon and its sculptures .
in 1806 , thomas bruce , 7th earl of elgin removed some of the surviving sculptures , with the permission of the ottoman empire .
these sculptures , now known as the elgin marbles or the parthenon marbles , were sold in 1816 to the british museum in london , where they are now displayed .
since 1983 ( on the initiative of culture minister melina mercouri ) , the greek government has been committed to the return of the sculptures to greece .
in statistics , stepwise regression includes regression models in which the choice of predictive variables is carried out by an automatic procedure .
usually , this takes the form of a sequence of f-tests , but other techniques are possible , such as t-tests , adjusted r-square , akaike information criterion , bayesian information criterion , mallows 's cp , or false discovery
the frequent practice of fitting the final selected model followed by reporting estimates and confidence intervals without adjusting them to take the model building process into account has led to calls to stop using stepwise model building altogether or to
in this example from engineering , necessity and sufficiency are usually determined by f-tests .
for additional consideration , when planning an experiment , computer simulation , or scientific survey to collect data for this model , one must keep in mind the number of parameters , p , to estimate and adjust the sample

world map showing the arctic circle in red .
map of the arctic with the arctic circle in blue .
the arctic circle is one of the five major circles of latitude that mark maps of the earth .
in 2012 , it is the parallel of latitude that runs north of the equator .
the region north of this circle is known as the arctic , and the zone just to the south is called the northern temperate zone .
the equivalent polar circle in the southern hemisphere is called the antarctic circle .
the arctic circle is the southernmost latitude in the northern hemisphere at which the sun can remain continuously above or below the horizon for 24 hours ( at the june solstice and december solstice respectively ) .
north of the arctic circle , the sun is above the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year ( and therefore visible at midnight ) and below the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per
on the arctic circle those events occur , in principle , exactly once per year , at the june and december solstices , respectively .
it would therefore seem that the arctic circle marks the southern extremity of the northern hemisphere polar day ( 24-hour sunlit day , often referred to as the midnight sun ) and polar night ( 24-hour sunless night ) .
in fact , because of atmospheric refraction and mirages , and because the sun appears as a disk and not a point , part of the midnight sun may be seen on the night of the northern summer solstice up
that is true at sea level ; those limits increase with elevation above sea level although in mountainous regions , there is often no direct view of the true horizon .
the position of the arctic circle is not fixed .
it directly depends on the earth 's axial tilt , which fluctuates within a margin of 2° over a 40,000 year period , notably due to tidal forces resulting from the orbit of the moon .
the arctic circle is currently drifting northwards at a speed of about per year ; see circle of latitude for more information .
an led traffic light in portsmouth , england
traffic lights , also known as traffic signals , traffic lamps , signal lights , robots in south africa and , in the past , semaphores , are signalling devices positioned at road intersections , pedestrian crossings and other locations
traffic lights were first installed in 1868 in london and are now used all over the world .
traffic lights alternate the right of way accorded to road users by displaying lights of a standard color ( red , yellow/amber , and green ) following a universal color code .
in the typical sequence of color phases :
the green light allows traffic to proceed in the direction denoted , if it is safe to do so
the yellow/amber light denoting prepare to stop short of the intersection , if it is safe to do so
the red signal prohibits any traffic from proceeding

i confess is a 1953 drama film directed by alfred hitchcock , and starring montgomery clift as fr. michael william logan , a catholic priest , anne baxter as ruth grandfort , and karl malden as inspector larrue .
biographers say hitchcock had trouble with `` method `` actors such as clift and paul newman , who worked with him in torn curtain ( 1966 ) .
in the book-length interview hitchcock/truffaut ( 1967 ) , hitchcock said he had hired anita björk as the female lead for i confess , after seeing her in miss julie ( 1951 ) .
however , when björk arrived in hollywood with her lover and their baby , warner bros. insisted that hitchcock find another actress .
the film is based on a 1902 french play by paul anthelme called nos deux consciences , a play hitchcock saw in the 1930s .
the screenplay was written by george tabori .
the movie was largely filmed on location in quebec city with numerous shots of the city landscape and interiors of its churches and other emblematic buildings , such as the château frontenac .

human serum albumin is the most abundant protein in human blood plasma .
it is produced in the liver .
albumin constitutes about half of the blood serum protein .
it is soluble and monomeric .
albumin transports hormones , fatty acids , and other compounds , buffers ph , and maintains osmotic pressure , among other functions .
albumin is synthesized in the liver as preproalbumin , which has an n-terminal peptide that is removed before the nascent protein is released from the rough endoplasmic reticulum .
the product , proalbumin , is in turn cleaved in the golgi vesicles to produce the secreted albumin .
the reference range for albumin concentrations in blood is 3.4 to 5.4 g/dl .
it has a serum half-life of approximately 20 days .
it has a molecular mass of 67 kda .
the gene for albumin is located on chromosome 4 and mutations in this gene can result in anomalous proteins .
the human albumin gene is 16,961 nucleotides long from the putative 'cap ' site to the first poly ( a ) addition site .
it is split into 15 exons that are symmetrically placed within the 3 domains thought to have arisen by triplication of a single primordial domain .

the attack on pearl harbor ( called hawaii operation or operation ai by the japanese imperial general headquarters ( operation z in planning ) and the battle of pearl harbor ) was a surprise military strike conducted by the imperial
from the standpoint of the defenders , the attack commenced at 7:48 a.m. hawaiian time .
the attack was intended as a preventive action in order to keep the u.s. pacific fleet from interfering with military actions the empire of japan was planning in southeast asia against overseas territories of the united kingdom , the netherlands
the base was attacked by 353 japanese fighters , bombers and torpedo planes in two waves , launched from six aircraft carriers .
all eight u.s. navy battleships were damaged , with four being sunk .
two of these were later raised , and with the remaining four repaired , six battleships returned to service later in the war .
the japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers , three destroyers , an anti-aircraft training ship , and one minelayer .
188 u.s. aircraft were destroyed ; 2,402 americans were killed and 1,282 wounded .
important base installations such as the power station , shipyard , maintenance , and fuel and torpedo storage facilities , as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building ( also home of the intelligence section ) were not attacked
japanese losses were light : 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost , and 65 servicemen killed or wounded .
one japanese sailor was captured .
the attack came as a profound shock to the american people and led directly to the american entry into world war ii in both the pacific and european theaters .
the following day ( december 8 ) , the united states declared war on japan .
domestic support for non-interventionism , which had been strong , disappeared .
clandestine support of britain ( for example the neutrality patrol ) was replaced by active alliance .
subsequent operations by the u.s. prompted germany and italy to declare war on the u.s. on december 11 , which was reciprocated by the u.s. the same day .
there were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by japan .
however , the lack of any formal warning , particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing , led president franklin d. roosevelt to proclaim december 7 , 1941 , `` a date which will live in infamy `` .
an associate degree is an undergraduate academic degree awarded by community colleges , junior colleges , technical colleges , and bachelor 's degree -granting colleges and universities upon completion of a course of study usually lasting two years .
in the united states , and some areas of canada , an associate degree is often equivalent to the first two years of a four-year college or university degree .
it is the lowest in the hierarchy of post-secondary academic degrees offered in these countries .
although an associate degree is not usually as lucrative as a bachelor 's degree , the resulting careers can still afford a respectable income , particularly in the healthcare field , with greater job security and much less student debt
moby-dick ; or , the whale is a novel by herman melville , first published in 1851 .
it is considered to be one of the great american novels and a treasure of world literature .
the story tells the adventures of wandering sailor ishmael , and his voyage on the whaleship pequod , commanded by captain ahab .
ishmael soon learns that ahab has one purpose on this voyage : to seek out moby dick , a ferocious , enigmatic white sperm whale .
in a previous encounter , the whale destroyed ahab 's boat and bit off his leg , which now drives ahab to take revenge .
in moby-dick , melville employs stylized language , symbolism , and the metaphor to explore numerous complex themes .
through the journey of the main characters , the concepts of class and social status , good and evil , and the existence of god are all examined , as the main characters speculate upon their personal beliefs and their
the narrator 's reflections , along with his descriptions of a sailor 's life aboard a whaling ship , are woven into the narrative along with shakespearean literary devices , such as stage directions , extended soliloquies , and asides
the book portrays destructive obsession and monomania , as well as the assumption of anthropomorphism —projecting human instincts , characteristics and motivations onto animals .
moby dick is ruthless in attacking the sailors who attempt to hunt and kill him , but it is ahab who invests moby dick 's natural instincts with malignant and evil intentions .
in fact , it is not the whale but the crippled ahab who alone possesses this characteristic .
moby-dick has been classified as american romanticism .
it was first published by richard bentley in london on october 18 , 1851 , in an expurgated three-volume edition titled the whale , and weeks later as a single volume , by new york city publisher harper and brothers
the book initially received mixed reviews , but moby-dick is now considered part of the western canon , and at the center of the canon of american novels .
`` moby-dick '' begins with the line `` call me ishmael . ''
according to the american book review 's rating in 2011 , this is one of the most recognizable opening lines in western literature .

lipoic acid ( la ) , also known as α-lipoic acid and alpha lipoic acid ( ala ) is an organosulfur compound derived from octanoic acid .
la contains two sulfur atoms ( at c6 and c8 ) connected by a disulfide bond and is thus considered to be oxidized although either sulfur atom can exist in higher oxidation states .
the carbon atom at c6 is chiral and the molecule exists as two enantiomers ( r ) - ( + ) -lipoic acid ( rla ) and ( s ) - ( - ) -lipoic acid ( sla ) and
only the ( r ) - ( + ) -enantiomer exists in nature and is an essential cofactor of four mitochondrial enzyme complexes .
endogenously synthesized rla is essential for aerobic metabolism .
both rla and r/s-la are available as over-the-counter nutritional supplements and have been used nutritionally and clinically since the 1950s for various diseases and conditions .
la appears physically as a yellow solid and structurally contains a terminal carboxylic acid and a terminal dithiolane ring .
the relationship between endogenously synthesized ( enzyme–bound ) rla and administered free rla or r/s-la has not been fully characterized but free plasma and cellular levels increase and decrease rapidly after oral consumption or intravenous injections .
`` lipoate '' is the conjugate base of lipoic acid , and the most prevalent form of la under physiologic conditions .
although the intracellular environment is strongly reducing , both free la and its reduced form , dihydrolipoic acid ( dhla ) , have been detected in cells after administration of la .
most endogenously produced rla is not “free” because octanoic acid , the precursor to rla , is bound to the enzyme complexes prior to enzymatic insertion of the sulfur atoms .
as a cofactor , rla is covalently attached by an amide bond to a terminal lysine residue of the enzyme’s lipoyl domains .
one of the most studied roles of rla is as a cofactor of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex ( pdc or pdhc ) , though it is a cofactor in other enzymatic systems as well ( described below ) .

paul revere ( december 21 , 1734may 10 , 1818 ) was an american silversmith , early industrialist , and a patriot in the american revolution .
he is most famous for alerting colonial militia of approaching british forces before the battles of lexington and concord , as dramatized in henry wadsworth longfellow 's poem , `` paul revere 's ride . ''
revere was a prosperous and prominent boston silversmith , who helped organize an intelligence and alarm system to keep watch on the british military .
revere later served as a massachusetts militia officer , though his service culminated after the penobscot expedition , one of the most disastrous campaigns of the american revolutionary war , for which he was absolved of blame .
following the war , revere returned to his silversmith trade and used the profits from his expanding business to finance his work in iron casting , bronze bell and cannon casting , and the forging of copper bolts and spikes
finally in 1800 he became the first american to successfully roll copper into sheets for use as sheathing on naval vessels .

three-phase transformer with four wire output for 208y/120 volt service : one wire for neutral , others for a , b and c phases
three-phase electric power transmission
three-phase electric power is a common method of alternating-current electric power generation , transmission , and distribution .
it is a type of polyphase system and is the most common method used by electrical grids worldwide to transfer power .
it is also used to power large motors and other heavy loads .
a three-phase system is usually more economical than an equivalent single-phase or two-phase system at the same voltage because it uses less conductor material to transmit electrical power .
the three-phase system was independently invented by galileo ferraris , mikhail dolivo-dobrovolsky and nikola tesla in the late 1880s .
michael jordan has won ten scoring titles in his career .
in basketball , points are the sum of the score accumulated through free throws or field goals .
the national basketball association 's ( nba ) scoring title is awarded to the player with the highest points per game average in a given season .
the scoring title was originally determined by total points scored until the 1968–69 season , after which points per game was used to determine the leader instead .
players who earned scoring titles before the 1979–80 season did not record any three-point field goals because the three-point line was first implemented in the nba during that season .
